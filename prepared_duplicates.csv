0,1066589,46898,How do I efficiently iterate over each entry in a Java Map?,"
If I have an object implementing the Map interface in Java and I wish to iterate over every pair contained within it,  what is the most efficient way of going through the map?
Will the ordering of elements depend on the specific map implementation that I have for the interface?
","2,562,322",3419,863,java dictionary collections iteration ,https://stackoverflow.com/questions/46898/how-do-i-efficiently-iterate-over-each-entry-in-a-java-map,44,"

    System.out.println(entry.getKey() + ""/"" + entry.getValue());
}

",5186,"
To summarize the other answers and combine them with what I know, I found 10 main ways to do this (see below). Also, I wrote some performance tests (see results below). For example, if we want to find the sum of all of the keys and values of a map, we can write:

Using iterator and Map.Entry
long i = 0;
Iterator<Map.Entry<Integer, Integer>> it = map.entrySet().iterator();
while (it.hasNext()) {
    Map.Entry<Integer, Integer> pair = it.next();
    i += pair.getKey() + pair.getValue();
}

Using foreach and Map.Entry
long i = 0;
for (Map.Entry<Integer, Integer> pair : map.entrySet()) {
    i += pair.getKey() + pair.getValue();
}

Using forEach from Java 8
final long[] i = {0};
map.forEach((k, v) -> i[0] += k + v);

Using keySet and foreach
long i = 0;
for (Integer key : map.keySet()) {
    i += key + map.get(key);
}

Using keySet and iterator
long i = 0;
Iterator<Integer> itr2 = map.keySet().iterator();
while (itr2.hasNext()) {
    Integer key = itr2.next();
    i += key + map.get(key);
}

Using for and Map.Entry
long i = 0;
for (Iterator<Map.Entry<Integer, Integer>> entries = map.entrySet().iterator(); entries.hasNext(); ) {
    Map.Entry<Integer, Integer> entry = entries.next();
    i += entry.getKey() + entry.getValue();
}

Using the Java 8 Stream API
final long[] i = {0};
map.entrySet().stream().forEach(e -> i[0] += e.getKey() + e.getValue());

Using the Java 8 Stream API parallel
final long[] i = {0};
map.entrySet().stream().parallel().forEach(e -> i[0] += e.getKey() + e.getValue());

Using IterableMap of Apache Collections
long i = 0;
MapIterator<Integer, Integer> it = iterableMap.mapIterator();
while (it.hasNext()) {
    i += it.next() + it.getValue();
}

Using MutableMap of Eclipse (CS) collections
final long[] i = {0};
mutableMap.forEachKeyValue((key, value) -> {
    i[0] += key + value;
});

1,1911109,1778088,How do I clone a single branch in Git?,"
I have a local Git repository called 'skeleton' that I use for storing project skeletons. It has a few branches, for different kinds of projects:
casey@agave [~/Projects/skeleton] git branch
* master
  rails
  c
  c++

If I want to check out the master branch for a new project, I can do
casey@agave [~/Projects] git clone skeleton new
Initialized empty Git repository in /Users/casey/Projects/new/.git/

and everything is how I want it. Specifically, the new master branch points to the skeleton master branch, and I can push and pull to move around changes to the basic project setup.
What doesn't work, however, is if I want to clone another branch. I can't get it so that I only pull the branch I want, for instance the rails branch, and then the new repository has a master branch that pushes to and pulls from the skeleton repository's rails branch, by default.
Is there a good way to go about doing this? Or, maybe this isn't the way that Git wants me to structure things, and I'm certainly open to that. Perhaps I should have multiple repositories, with the Ruby on Rails skeleton repository tracking the master skeleton repository? And any individual project cloning the Ruby on Rails skeleton repository.

Note: the git1.7.10 (April 2012) actually allows you to clone only one branch:
# clone only the remote primary HEAD (default: origin/master)
git clone <url> --single-branch

# as in:
git clone <url> --branch <branch> --single-branch [<folder>]

You can see it in t5500-fetch-pack.sh:
test_expect_success 'single branch clone' '
  git clone --single-branch ""file://$(pwd)/."" singlebranch
'

Tobu comments that:

This is implicit when doing a shallow clone.
This makes git clone --depth 1 the easiest way to save bandwidth.

And since Git 1.9.0 (February 2014), shallow clones support data transfer (push/pull), so that option is even more useful now.
See more at ""Is git clone --depth 1 (shallow clone) more useful than it makes out?"".

""Undoing"" a shallow clone is detailed at ""Convert shallow clone to full clone"" (git 1.8.3+)
# unshallow the current branch
git fetch --unshallow

# for getting back all the branches (see Peter Cordes' comment)
git config remote.origin.fetch refs/heads/*:refs/remotes/origin/*
git fetch --unshallow

As Chris comments:

the magic line for getting missing branches to reverse --single-branch is (git v2.1.4):

git config remote.origin.fetch +refs/heads/*:refs/remotes/origin/*
git fetch --unshallow  


With Git 2.26 (Q1 2020), ""git clone --recurse-submodules --single-branch"" now uses the same single-branch option when cloning the submodules.
See commit 132f600, commit 4731957 (21 Feb 2020) by Emily Shaffer (nasamuffin).

Signed-off-by: Emily Shaffer
Acked-by: Jeff King
Previously, performing ""git clone --recurse-submodules --single-branch"" resulted in submodules cloning all branches even though the superproject cloned only one branch.
Pipe --single-branch through the submodule helper framework to make it to 'clone' later on.

One way is to execute the following.
git clone user@git-server:project_name.git -b branch_name /your/folder

Where branch_name is the branch of your choice and ""/your/folder"" is the destination folder for that branch. It's true that this will bring other branches giving you the opportunity to merge back and forth. 
Update
Now, starting with Git 1.7.10, you can now do this
git clone user@git-server:project_name.git -b branch_name --single-branch /your/folder

3,576169,222877,What does 'super' do in Python?,"
What's the difference between:
class Child(SomeBaseClass):
    def __init__(self):
        super(Child, self).__init__()

and:
class Child(SomeBaseClass):
    def __init__(self):
        SomeBaseClass.__init__(self)

I've seen super being used quite a lot in classes with only single inheritance. I can see why you'd use it in multiple inheritance but am unclear as to what the advantages are of using it in this kind of situation.
","227,378",587,252,python oop inheritance super ,https://stackoverflow.com/questions/222877/what-does-super-do-in-python,10,"
The benefits of super() in single-inheritance are minimal -- mostly, you don't have to hard-code the name of the base class into every method that uses its parent methods.
However, it's almost impossible to use multiple-inheritance without super(). This includes common idioms like mixins, interfaces, abstract classes, etc. This extends to code that later extends yours. If somebody later wanted to write a class that extended Child and a mixin, their code would not work properly.
",321,"
What's the difference?
SomeBaseClass.__init__(self) 

means to call SomeBaseClass's __init__. while
super(Child, self).__init__()

means to call a bound __init__ from the parent class that follows Child in the instance's Method Resolution Order (MRO). 
If the instance is a subclass of Child, there may be a different parent that comes next in the MRO. 
Explained simply
When you write a class, you want other classes to be able to use it. super() makes it easier for other classes to use the class you're writing.
As Bob Martin says, a good architecture allows you to postpone decision making as long as possible.
super() can enable that sort of architecture.
When another class subclasses the class you wrote, it could also be inheriting from other classes. And those classes could have an __init__ that comes after this __init__ based on the ordering of the classes for method resolution.
Without super you would likely hard-code the parent of the class you're writing (like the example does). This would mean that you would not call the next __init__ in the MRO, and you would thus not get to reuse the code in it.
If you're writing your own code for personal use, you may not care about this distinction. But if you want others to use your code, using super is one thing that allows greater flexibility for users of the code.
Python 2 versus 3
This works in Python 2 and 3:
super(Child, self).__init__()

This only works in Python 3:
super().__init__()

It works with no arguments by moving up in the stack frame and getting the first argument to the method (usually self for an instance method or cls for a class method - but could be other names) and finding the class (e.g. Child) in the free variables (it is looked up with the name __class__ as a free closure variable in the method).
I prefer to demonstrate the cross-compatible way of using super, but if you are only using Python 3, you can call it with no arguments.
Indirection with Forward Compatibility
What does it give you? For single inheritance, the examples from the question are practically identical from a static analysis point of view. However, using super gives you a layer of indirection with forward compatibility.
Forward compatibility is very important to seasoned developers. You want your code to keep working with minimal changes as you change it. When you look at your revision history, you want to see precisely what changed when. 
You may start off with single inheritance, but if you decide to add another base class, you only have to change the line with the bases - if the bases change in a class you inherit from (say a mixin is added) you'd change nothing in this class. Particularly in Python 2, getting the arguments to super and the correct method arguments right can be difficult. If you know you're using super correctly with single inheritance, that makes debugging less difficult going forward.
Dependency Injection
Other people can use your code and inject parents into the method resolution:
class SomeBaseClass(object):
    def __init__(self):
        print('SomeBaseClass.__init__(self) called')

class UnsuperChild(SomeBaseClass):
    def __init__(self):
        print('UnsuperChild.__init__(self) called')
        SomeBaseClass.__init__(self)

class SuperChild(SomeBaseClass):
    def __init__(self):
        print('SuperChild.__init__(self) called')
        super(SuperChild, self).__init__()

Say you add another class to your object, and want to inject a class between Foo and Bar (for testing or some other reason):
class InjectMe(SomeBaseClass):
    def __init__(self):
        print('InjectMe.__init__(self) called')
        super(InjectMe, self).__init__()

class UnsuperInjector(UnsuperChild, InjectMe): pass

class SuperInjector(SuperChild, InjectMe): pass

Using the un-super child fails to inject the dependency because the child you're using has hard-coded the method to be called after its own:
>>> o = UnsuperInjector()
UnsuperChild.__init__(self) called
SomeBaseClass.__init__(self) called

However, the class with the child that uses super can correctly inject the dependency:
>>> o2 = SuperInjector()
SuperChild.__init__(self) called
InjectMe.__init__(self) called
SomeBaseClass.__init__(self) called

Addressing a comment

Why in the world would this be useful? 

Python linearizes a complicated inheritance tree via the C3 linearization algorithm to create a Method Resolution Order (MRO).
We want methods to be looked up in that order.
For a method defined in a parent to find the next one in that order without super, it would have to 

get the mro from the instance's type 
look for the type that defines the method
find the next type with the method
bind that method and call it with the expected arguments


The UnsuperChild should not have access to InjectMe. Why isn't the conclusion ""Always avoid using super""? What am I missing here?

The UnsuperChild does not have access to InjectMe. It is the UnsuperInjector that has access to InjectMe - and yet cannot call that class's method from the method it inherits from UnsuperChild. 
Both Child classes intend to call a method by the same name that comes next in the MRO, which might be another class it was not aware of when it was created. 
The one without super hard-codes its parent's method - thus is has restricted the behavior of its method, and subclasses cannot inject functionality in the call chain.
The one with super has greater flexibility. The call chain for the methods can be intercepted and functionality injected.
You may not need that functionality, but subclassers of your code may.
Conclusion
Always use super to reference the parent class instead of hard-coding it.
What you intend is to reference the parent class that is next-in-line, not specifically the one you see the child inheriting from.
Not using super can put unnecessary constraints on users of your code.

.gitignore will prevent untracked files from being added (without an add -f) to the set of files tracked by git, however git will continue to track any files that are already being tracked.
To stop tracking a file you need to remove it from the index. This can be achieved with this command.
git rm --cached <file>

If you want to remove a whole folder, you need to remove all files in it recursively.
git rm -r --cached <folder>

What's the best way of checking if an object property in JavaScript is undefined?
","1,227,820",2910,524,javascript object undefined object-property ,https://stackoverflow.com/questions/27509/detecting-an-undefined-object-property,47,"
The usual way to check if the value of a property is the special value undefined, is:
if(o.myProperty === undefined) {
  alert(""myProperty value is the special value `undefined`"");
}

To check if an object does not actually have such a property, and will therefore return undefined by default when you try and access it:
if(!o.hasOwnProperty('myProperty')) {
  alert(""myProperty does not exist"");
}

To check if the value associated with an identifier is the special value undefined, or if that identifier has not been declared. Note: this method is the only way of referring to an undeclared (note: different from having a value of undefined) identifier without an early error:
if(typeof myVariable === 'undefined') {
  alert('myVariable is either the special value `undefined`, or it has not been declared');
}

In versions of JavaScript prior to ECMAScript 5, the property named ""undefined"" on the global object was writeable, and therefore a simple check foo === undefined might behave unexpectedly if it had accidentally been redefined. In modern JavaScript, the property is read-only.
However, in modern JavaScript, ""undefined"" is not a keyword, and so variables inside functions can be named ""undefined"" and shadow the global property. 
If you are worried about this (unlikely) edge case, you can use the void operator to get at the special undefined value itself:
if(myVariable === void 0) {
  alert(""myVariable is the special value `undefined`"");
}

",2739,"
I believe there are a number of incorrect answers to this topic. Contrary to common belief, ""undefined"" is not a keyword in JavaScript and can in fact have a value assigned to it.
Correct Code
The most robust way to perform this test is:
if (typeof myVar === ""undefined"")

This will always return the correct result, and even handles the situation where myVar is not declared.
Degenerate code. DO NOT USE.
var undefined = false;  // Shockingly, this is completely legal!
if (myVar === undefined) {
    alert(""You have been misled. Run away!"");
}

Additionally, myVar === undefined will raise an error in the situation where myVar is undeclared.

I want to merge two branches that have been separated for a while and wanted to know which files have been modified.
Came across this link: http://linux.yyz.us/git-howto.html which was quite useful.
The tools to compare branches I've come across are:

git diff master..branch
git log master..branch
git shortlog master..branch

Was wondering if there's something like ""git status master..branch"" to only see those files that are different between the two branches.
Without creating a new tool, I think this is the closest you can get to do that now (which of course will show repeats if a file was modified more than once):

I am trying to center my tabs content vertically, but when I add the CSS style display:inline-flex, the horizontal text-align disappears.

","350,629",431,166,html css ,https://stackoverflow.com/questions/19461521/how-to-center-an-element-horizontally-and-vertically,23,"

Approach 1 - transform translateX/translateY:
Example Here / Full Screen Example
In supported browsers (most of them), you can use top: 50%/left: 50% in combination with  translateX(-50%) translateY(-50%) to dynamically vertically/horizontally center the element.



.container {
    position: absolute;
    top: 50%;
    left: 50%;
    -moz-transform: translateX(-50%) translateY(-50%);
    -webkit-transform: translateX(-50%) translateY(-50%);
    transform: translateX(-50%) translateY(-50%);
}
<div class=""container"">
    <span>I'm vertically/horizontally centered!</span>
</div>





Approach 2 - Flexbox method:
Example Here / Full Screen Example
In supported browsers, set the display of the targeted element to flex and use align-items: center for vertical centering and justify-content: center for horizontal centering. Just don't forget to add vendor prefixes for additional browser support (see example).



html, body, .container {
    height: 100%;
}

.container {
    display: -webkit-flexbox;
    display: -ms-flexbox;
    display: -webkit-flex;
    display: flex;
    -webkit-flex-align: center;
    -ms-flex-align: center;
    -webkit-align-items: center;
    align-items: center;
    justify-content: center;
}
<div class=""container""> 
  <span>I'm vertically/horizontally centered!</span>
</div>





Approach 3 - table-cell/vertical-align: middle:
Example Here / Full Screen Example
In some cases, you will need to ensure that the html/body element's height is set to 100%.
For vertical alignment, set the parent element's width/height to 100% and add display: table. Then for the child element, change the display to table-cell and add vertical-align: middle.
For horizontal centering, you could either add text-align: center to center the text and any other inline children elements. Alternatively, you could use margin: 0 auto, assuming the element is block level.



html, body {
    height: 100%;
}
.parent {
    width: 100%;
    height: 100%;
    display: table;
    text-align: center;
}
.parent > .child {
    display: table-cell;
    vertical-align: middle;
}
<section class=""parent"">
    <div class=""child"">I'm vertically/horizontally centered!</div>
</section>





Approach 4 - Absolutely positioned 50% from the top with displacement:
Example Here / Full Screen Example
This approach assumes that the text has a known height - in this instance, 18px. Just absolutely position the element 50% from the top, relative to the parent element. Use a negative margin-top value that is half of the element's known height, in this case - -9px.



html, body, .container {
    height: 100%;
}

.container {
    position: relative;
    text-align: center;
}

.container > p {
    position: absolute;
    top: 50%;
    left: 0;
    right: 0;
    margin-top: -9px;
}
<div class=""container"">
    <p>I'm vertically/horizontally centered!</p>
</div>





Approach 5 - The line-height method (Least flexible - not suggested):
Example Here
In some cases, the parent element will have a fixed height. For vertical centering, all you have to do is set a line-height value on the child element equal to the fixed height of the parent element.
Though this solution will work in some cases, it's worth noting that it won't work when there are multiple lines of text - like this.



.parent {
    height: 200px;
    width: 400px;
    background: lightgray;
    text-align: center;
}

.parent > .child {
    line-height: 200px;
}
<div class=""parent"">
    <span class=""child"">I'm vertically/horizontally centered!</span>
</div>



",699,"
If CSS3 is an option (or you have a fallback) you can use transform:
.center {
    right: 50%;
    bottom: 50%;
    transform: translate(50%,50%);
    position: absolute;
}

Unlike the first approach above, you don't want to use left:50% with the negative translation because there's an overflow bug in IE9+. Utilize a positive right value and you won't see horizontal scrollbars.

I would like to see what is the best way to determine the current script directory in Python.
I discovered that, due to the many ways of calling Python code, it is hard to find a good solution.
Here are some problems:

__file__ is not defined if the script is executed with exec, execfile
__module__ is defined only in modules

Use cases:

./myfile.py
python myfile.py
./somedir/myfile.py
python somedir/myfile.py
execfile('myfile.py') (from another script, that can be located in another directory and that can have another current directory.

I know that there is no perfect solution, but I'm looking for the best approach that solves most of the cases.
The most used approach is os.path.dirname(os.path.abspath(__file__)) but this really doesn't work if you execute the script from another one with exec().
Warning
Any solution that uses current directory will fail, this can be different based on the way the script is called or it can be changed inside the running script.

It's unusual to be executing a script with exec/execfile; normally you should be using the module infrastructure to load scripts. If you must use these methods, I suggest setting __file__ in the globals you pass to the script so it can read that filename.
There's no other way to get the filename in execed code: as you note, the CWD may be in a completely different place.

I'm trying to write a function that either accepts a list of strings, or a single string. If it's a string, then I want to convert it to an array with just the one item so I can loop over it without fear of an error.

I've rounded up the various solutions below and created a jsperf test. They're all fast, so just use Array.isArray -- it's well-supported now and works across frames.

In modern browsers you can do:
Array.isArray(obj)

(Supported by Chrome 5, Firefox 4.0, IE 9, Opera 10.5 and Safari 5)
For backward compatibility you can add the following:
// only implement if no native implementation is available
if (typeof Array.isArray === 'undefined') {
  Array.isArray = function(obj) {
    return Object.prototype.toString.call(obj) === '[object Array]';
  }
};

If you use jQuery you can use jQuery.isArray(obj) or $.isArray(obj). If you use underscore you can use _.isArray(obj).
If you don't need to detect arrays created in different frames you can also just use instanceof:
obj instanceof Array

",1146,"
The method given in the ECMAScript standard to find the class of Object is to use the toString method from Object.prototype.
if( Object.prototype.toString.call( someVar ) === '[object Array]' ) {
    alert( 'Array!' );
}

Or you could use typeof to test if it is a String:
if( typeof someVar === 'string' ) {
    someVar = [ someVar ];
}

Or if you're not concerned about performance, you could just do a concat to a new empty Array.
someVar = [].concat( someVar );

There's also the constructor which you can query directly:
if (somevar.constructor.name == ""Array"") {
    // do something
}

Assuming you're joining on columns with no duplicates, which is a very common case:

An inner join of A and B gives the result of A intersect B, i.e. the inner part of a Venn diagram intersection.
An outer join of A and B gives the results of A union B, i.e. the outer parts of a Venn diagram union.

Examples
Suppose you have two tables, with a single column each, and data as follows:
A    B
-    -
1    3
2    4
3    5
4    6

Note that (1,2) are unique to A, (3,4) are common, and (5,6) are unique to B.
Inner join
An inner join using either of the equivalent queries gives the intersection of the two tables, i.e. the two rows they have in common.
select * from a INNER JOIN b on a.a = b.b;
select a.*, b.*  from a,b where a.a = b.b;

a | b
--+--
3 | 3
4 | 4

Left outer join
A left outer join will give all rows in A, plus any common rows in B.
select * from a LEFT OUTER JOIN b on a.a = b.b;
select a.*, b.*  from a,b where a.a = b.b(+);

a |  b
--+-----
1 | null
2 | null
3 |    3
4 |    4

Right outer join
A right outer join will give all rows in B, plus any common rows in A.
select * from a RIGHT OUTER JOIN b on a.a = b.b;
select a.*, b.*  from a,b where a.a(+) = b.b;

a    |  b
-----+----
3    |  3
4    |  4
null |  5
null |  6

Full outer join
A full outer join will give you the union of A and B, i.e. all the rows in A and all the rows in B. If something in A doesn't have a corresponding datum in B, then the B portion is null, and vice versa.
select * from a FULL OUTER JOIN b on a.a = b.b;

 a   |  b

The Venn diagrams don't really do it for me.
They don't show any distinction between a cross join and an inner join, for example, or more generally show any distinction between different types of join predicate or provide a framework for reasoning about how they will operate.
There is no substitute for understanding the logical processing and it is relatively straightforward to grasp anyway.

Imagine a cross join.
Evaluate the on clause against all rows from step 1 keeping those where the predicate evaluates to true
(For outer joins only) add back in any outer rows that were lost in step 2.

(NB: In practice the query optimiser may find more efficient ways of executing the query than the purely logical description above but the final result must be the same)
I'll start off with an animated version of a full outer join. Further explanation follows.


Explanation
Source Tables

First start with a CROSS JOIN (AKA Cartesian Product). This does not have an ON clause and simply returns every combination of rows from the two tables.
SELECT A.Colour, B.Colour FROM A CROSS JOIN B

Inner and Outer joins have an ""ON"" clause predicate.

Inner Join. Evaluate the condition in the ""ON"" clause for all rows in the cross join result. If true return the joined row. Otherwise discard it.
Left Outer Join. Same as inner join then for any rows in the left table that did not match anything output these with NULL values for the right table columns.
Right Outer Join. Same as inner join then for any rows in the right table that did not  match anything output these with NULL values for the left table columns.
Full Outer Join. Same as inner join then preserve left non matched rows as in left outer join and right non matching rows as per right outer join.

Some examples
SELECT A.Colour, B.Colour FROM A INNER JOIN B ON A.Colour = B.Colour
The above is the classic equi join.

Animated Version

SELECT A.Colour, B.Colour FROM A INNER JOIN B ON A.Colour NOT IN ('Green','Blue')
The inner join condition need not necessarily be an equality condition and it need not reference columns from both (or even either) of the tables. Evaluating A.Colour NOT IN ('Green','Blue') on each row of the cross join returns.

SELECT A.Colour, B.Colour FROM A INNER JOIN B ON 1 =1
The join condition evaluates to true for all rows in the cross join result so this is just the same as a cross join. I won't repeat the picture of the 16 rows again.
SELECT A.Colour, B.Colour FROM A LEFT OUTER JOIN B ON A.Colour = B.Colour
Outer Joins are logically evaluated in the same way as inner joins except that if a row from the left table (for a left join) does not join with any rows from the right hand table at all it is preserved in the result with NULL values for the right hand columns.

SELECT A.Colour, B.Colour FROM A LEFT OUTER JOIN B ON A.Colour = B.Colour WHERE B.Colour IS NULL
This simply restricts the previous result to only return the rows where B.Colour IS NULL. In this particular case these will be the rows that were preserved as they had no match in the right hand table and the query returns the single red row not matched in table B. This is known as an anti semi join.
It is important to select a column for the IS NULL test that is either not nullable or for which the join condition ensures that any NULL values will be excluded in order for this pattern to work correctly and avoid just bringing back rows which happen to have a NULL value for that column in addition to the un matched rows.

SELECT A.Colour, B.Colour FROM A RIGHT OUTER JOIN B ON A.Colour = B.Colour
Right outer joins act similarly to left outer joins except they preserve non matching rows from the right table and null extend the left hand columns.

SELECT A.Colour, B.Colour FROM A FULL OUTER JOIN B ON A.Colour = B.Colour
Full outer joins combine the behaviour of left and right joins and preserve the non matching rows from both the left and the right tables.

SELECT A.Colour, B.Colour FROM A FULL OUTER JOIN B ON 1 = 0
No rows in the cross join match the 1=0 predicate. All rows from both sides are preserved using normal outer join rules with NULL in the columns from the table on the other side.

SELECT COALESCE(A.Colour, B.Colour) AS Colour FROM A FULL OUTER JOIN B ON 1 = 0
With a minor amend to the preceding query one could simulate a UNION ALL of the two tables.

SELECT A.Colour, B.Colour FROM A LEFT OUTER JOIN B ON A.Colour = B.Colour WHERE B.Colour = 'Green'
Note that the WHERE clause (if present) logically runs after the join. One common error is to perform a left outer join and then include a WHERE clause with a condition on the right table that ends up excluding the non matching rows. The above ends up performing the outer join...

... And then the ""Where"" clause runs. NULL= 'Green' does not evaluate to true so the row preserved by the outer join ends up discarded (along with the blue one) effectively converting the join back to an inner one.

If the intention was to include only rows from B where Colour is Green and all rows from A regardless the correct syntax would be
SELECT A.Colour, B.Colour FROM A LEFT OUTER JOIN B ON A.Colour = B.Colour AND B.Colour = 'Green'

What are the proper uses of:

reinterpret_cast
C-style cast (type)value
Function-style cast type(value)

How does one decide which to use in which specific cases?
","574,244",2580,1670,c++ pointers casting c++-faq ,https://stackoverflow.com/questions/332030/when-should-static-cast-dynamic-cast-const-cast-and-reinterpret-cast-be-used,9,"
static_cast is the first cast you should attempt to use. It does things like implicit conversions between types (such as int to float, or pointer to void*), and it can also call explicit conversion functions (or implicit ones). In many cases, explicitly stating static_cast isn't necessary, but it's important to note that the T(something) syntax is equivalent to (T)something and should be avoided (more on that later). A T(something, something_else) is safe, however, and guaranteed to call the constructor.
static_cast can also cast through inheritance hierarchies. It is unnecessary when casting upwards (towards a base class), but when casting downwards it can be used as long as it doesn't cast through virtual inheritance. It does not do checking, however, and it is undefined behavior to static_cast down a hierarchy to a type that isn't actually the type of the object.

const_cast can be used to remove or add const to a variable; no other C++ cast is capable of removing it (not even reinterpret_cast). It is important to note that modifying a formerly const value is only undefined if the original variable is const; if you use it to take the const off a reference to something that wasn't declared with const, it is safe. This can be useful when overloading member functions based on const, for instance. It can also be used to add const to an object, such as to call a member function overload.
const_cast also works similarly on volatile, though that's less common.

dynamic_cast is exclusively used for handling polymorphism. You can cast a pointer or reference to any polymorphic type to any other class type (a polymorphic type has at least one virtual function, declared or inherited). You can use it for more than just casting downwards – you can cast sideways or even up another chain. The dynamic_cast will seek out the desired object and return it if possible. If it can't, it will return nullptr in the case of a pointer, or throw std::bad_cast in the case of a reference.
dynamic_cast has some limitations, though. It doesn't work if there are multiple objects of the same type in the inheritance hierarchy (the so-called 'dreaded diamond') and you aren't using virtual inheritance. It also can only go through public inheritance - it will always fail to travel through protected or private inheritance. This is rarely an issue, however, as such forms of inheritance are rare.

reinterpret_cast is the most dangerous cast, and should be used very sparingly. It turns one type directly into another — such as casting the value from one pointer to another, or storing a pointer in an int, or all sorts of other nasty things. Largely, the only guarantee you get with reinterpret_cast is that normally if you cast the result back to the original type, you will get the exact same value (but not if the intermediate type is smaller than the original type). There are a number of conversions that reinterpret_cast cannot do, too. It's used primarily for particularly weird conversions and bit manipulations, like turning a raw data stream into actual data, or storing data in the low bits of a pointer to aligned data.

C-style cast and function-style cast are casts using (type)object or type(object), respectively, and are functionally equivalent. They are defined as the first of the following which succeeds:

const_cast
static_cast (though ignoring access restrictions)
static_cast (see above), then const_cast
reinterpret_cast
reinterpret_cast, then const_cast

It can therefore be used as a replacement for other casts in some instances, but can be extremely dangerous because of the ability to devolve into a reinterpret_cast, and the latter should be preferred when explicit casting is needed, unless you are sure static_cast will succeed or reinterpret_cast will fail. Even then, consider the longer, more explicit option.
C-style casts also ignore access control when performing a static_cast, which means that they have the ability to perform an operation that no other cast can. This is mostly a kludge, though, and in my mind is just another reason to avoid C-style casts.
",2638,"
Use dynamic_cast for converting pointers/references within an inheritance hierarchy.
Use static_cast for ordinary type conversions.
Use reinterpret_cast for low-level reinterpreting of bit patterns.  Use with extreme caution.
Use const_cast for casting away const/volatile.  Avoid this unless you are stuck using a const-incorrect API.

The problem with the other two answers is that the new master doesn't have the old master as an ancestor, so when you push it, everyone else will get messed up. This is what you want to do:
git checkout better_branch
git merge --strategy=ours master    # keep the content of this branch, but record a merge
git checkout master
git merge better_branch             # fast-forward master up to the merge

You need to make sure that no other users of this repository are fetching the incorrect changes or trying to build on top of the commits that you want removed because you are about to rewind history.
Then you need to 'force' push the old reference.
git push -f origin last_known_good_commit:branch_name

or in your case
git push -f origin cc4b63bebb6:alpha-0.3.0

You may have receive.denyNonFastForwards set on the remote repository. If this is the case, then you will get an error which includes the phrase [remote rejected].
In this scenario, you will have to delete and recreate the branch.
git push origin :alpha-0.3.0
git push origin cc4b63bebb6:refs/heads/alpha-0.3.0

If this doesn't work - perhaps because you have receive.denyDeletes set, then you have to have direct access to the repository. In the remote repository, you then have to do something like the following plumbing command.
git update-ref refs/heads/alpha-0.3.0 cc4b63bebb6 83c9191dea8

I believe that you can also do this:

I'm using JSLint to go through JavaScript, and it's returning many suggestions to replace == (two equals signs) with === (three equals signs) when doing things like comparing idSele_UNVEHtype.value.length == 0 inside of an if statement.
Is there a performance benefit to replacing == with ===? 
Any performance improvement would be welcomed as many comparison operators exist.
If no type conversion takes place, would there be a performance gain over ==?
","1,841,804",5662,1908,javascript operators equality equality-operator identity-operator ,https://stackoverflow.com/questions/359494/which-equals-operator-vs-should-be-used-in-javascript-comparisons,49,"
The strict equality operator (===) behaves identically to the abstract equality operator (==) except no type conversion is done, and the types must be the same to be considered equal.
Reference: Javascript Tutorial: Comparison Operators
The == operator will compare for equality after doing any necessary type conversions.  The === operator will not do the conversion, so if two values are not the same type === will simply return false. Both are equally quick.
To quote Douglas Crockford's excellent JavaScript: The Good Parts,

JavaScript has two sets of equality operators: === and !==, and their evil twins == and !=.  The good ones work the way you would expect.  If the two operands are of the same type and have the same value, then === produces true and !== produces false.  The evil twins do the right thing when the operands are of the same type, but if they are of different types, they attempt to coerce the values.  the rules by which they do that are complicated and unmemorable.  These are some of the interesting cases:
'' == '0'           // false
0 == ''             // true
0 == '0'            // true

false == 'false'    // false
false == '0'        // true

false == undefined  // false
false == null       // false
null == undefined   // true

' \t\r\n ' == 0     // true




The lack of transitivity is alarming.  My advice is to never use the evil twins.  Instead, always use === and !==.  All of the comparisons just shown produce false with the === operator.


Update:
A good point was brought up by @Casebash in the comments and in @Phillipe Laybaert's answer concerning objects.  For objects, == and === act consistently with one another (except in a special case).
var a = [1,2,3];
var b = [1,2,3];

var c = { x: 1, y: 2 };
var d = { x: 1, y: 2 };

var e = ""text"";
var f = ""te"" + ""xt"";

a == b            // false
a === b           // false

c == d            // false
c === d           // false

e == f            // true
e === f           // true

The special case is when you compare a primitive with an object that evaluates to the same primitive, due to its toString or valueOf method. For example, consider the comparison of a string primitive with a string object created using the String constructor.
""abc"" == new String(""abc"")    // true
""abc"" === new String(""abc"")   // false

Here the == operator is checking the values of the two objects and returning true, but the === is seeing that they're not the same type and returning false.  Which one is correct?  That really depends on what you're trying to compare.  My advice is to bypass the question entirely and just don't use the String constructor to create string objects from string literals.
Reference
http://www.ecma-international.org/ecma-262/5.1/#sec-11.9.3
",6641,"
Using the == operator (Equality)
true == 1; //true, because 'true' is converted to 1 and then compared
""2"" == 2;  //true, because ""2"" is converted to 2 and then compared

Using the === operator (Identity)
true === 1; //false
""2"" === 2;  //false

This is because the equality operator == does type coercion, meaning that the interpreter implicitly tries to convert the values before comparing.
On the other hand, the identity operator === does not do type coercion, and thus does not convert the values when comparing, and is therefore faster (as according to This JS benchmark test) as it skips one step.

18,12179271,136097,Difference between staticmethod and classmethod,"
What is the difference between a function decorated with @staticmethod and one decorated with @classmethod?
","817,352",3745,1367,python oop methods python-decorators ,https://stackoverflow.com/questions/136097/difference-between-staticmethod-and-classmethod,27,"
Maybe a bit of example code will help: Notice the difference in the call signatures of foo, class_foo and static_foo:
class A(object):
    def foo(self, x):
        print ""executing foo(%s, %s)"" % (self, x)

    @classmethod
    def class_foo(cls, x):
        print ""executing class_foo(%s, %s)"" % (cls, x)

    @staticmethod
    def static_foo(x):
        print ""executing static_foo(%s)"" % x    

a = A()

Below is the usual way an object instance calls a method. The object instance, a, is implicitly passed as the first argument.
a.foo(1)
# executing foo(<__main__.A object at 0xb7dbef0c>,1)


With classmethods, the class of the object instance is implicitly passed as the first argument instead of self.
a.class_foo(1)
# executing class_foo(<class '__main__.A'>,1)

You can also call class_foo using the class. In fact, if you define something to be
a classmethod, it is probably because you intend to call it from the class rather than from a class instance. A.foo(1) would have raised a TypeError, but A.class_foo(1) works just fine:
A.class_foo(1)
# executing class_foo(<class '__main__.A'>,1)

One use people have found for class methods is to create inheritable alternative constructors.

With staticmethods, neither self (the object instance) nor  cls (the class) is implicitly passed as the first argument. They behave like plain functions except that you can call them from an instance or the class:
a.static_foo(1)
# executing static_foo(1)

A.static_foo('hi')
# executing static_foo(hi)

Staticmethods are used to group functions which have some logical connection with a class to the class.

foo is just a function, but when you call a.foo you don't just get the function,
you get a ""partially applied"" version of the function with the object instance a bound as the first argument to the function. foo expects 2 arguments, while a.foo only expects 1 argument.
a is bound to foo. That is what is meant by the term ""bound"" below:
print(a.foo)
# <bound method A.foo of <__main__.A object at 0xb7d52f0c>>

With a.class_foo, a is not bound to class_foo, rather the class A is bound to class_foo.
print(a.class_foo)
# <bound method type.class_foo of <class '__main__.A'>>

Here, with a staticmethod, even though it is a method, a.static_foo just returns
a good 'ole function with no arguments bound. static_foo expects 1 argument, and
a.static_foo expects 1 argument too.
print(a.static_foo)
# <function static_foo at 0xb7d479cc>

And of course the same thing happens when you call static_foo with the class A instead.
print(A.static_foo)
# <function static_foo at 0xb7d479cc>

",3284,"
A staticmethod is a method that knows nothing about the class or instance it was called on. It just gets the arguments that were passed, no implicit first argument. It is basically useless in Python -- you can just use a module function instead of a staticmethod.
A classmethod, on the other hand, is a method that gets passed the class it was called on, or the class of the instance it was called on, as first argument. This is useful when you want the method to be a factory for the class: since it gets the actual class it was called on as first argument, you can always instantiate the right class, even when subclasses are involved. Observe for instance how dict.fromkeys(), a classmethod, returns an instance of the subclass when called on a subclass:
>>> class DictSubclass(dict):
...     def __repr__(self):
...         return ""DictSubclass""
... 
>>> dict.fromkeys(""abc"")
{'a': None, 'c': None, 'b': None}
>>> DictSubclass.fromkeys(""abc"")

I put together a small benchmark, and here are roughly the results of repeating the above options 100,000 times:
jQuery 1.4, 1.5, 1.6
               Chrome 11  Firefox 4   IE9

<div>            3500ms
<div></div>      3500ms
createElement     100ms

I think it's no big surprise, but document.createElement is the fastest method. Of course, before you go off and start refactoring your entire codebase, remember that the differences we're talking about here (in all but the archaic versions of jQuery) equate to about an extra 3 milliseconds per thousand elements.

Simply supplying the HTML of elements you want to add to a jQuery constructor $() will return a jQuery object from newly built HTML, suitable for being appended into the DOM using jQuery's append() method.
For example:
var t = $(""<table cellspacing='0' class='text'></table>"");
$.append(t);

You could then populate this table programmatically, if you wished.
This gives you the ability to specify any arbitrary HTML you like, including class names or other attributes, which you might find more concise than using createElement and then setting attributes like cellSpacing and className via JS.

Get all non-unique values (i.e.: duplicate/more than one occurrence) in an array

With JavaScript 1.6 / ECMAScript 5 you can use the native filter method of an Array in the following way to get an array with unique values:


function onlyUnique(value, index, self) {
  return self.indexOf(value) === index;
}

// usage example:
var a = ['a', 1, 'a', 2, '1'];
var unique = a.filter(onlyUnique);

console.log(unique); // ['a', 1, 2, '1']



The native method filter will loop through the array and leave only those entries that pass the given callback function onlyUnique.
onlyUnique checks, if the given value is the first occurring. If not, it must be a duplicate and will not be copied.
This solution works without any extra library like jQuery or prototype.js.
It works for arrays with mixed value types too.
For old Browsers (<ie9), that do not support the native methods filter and indexOf you can find work arounds in the MDN documentation for filter and indexOf.
If you want to keep the last occurrence of a value, simple replace indexOf by lastIndexOf.
With ES6 it could be shorten to this:


// usage example:
var myArray = ['a', 1, 'a', 2, '1'];
var unique = myArray.filter((v, i, a) => a.indexOf(v) === i);

console.log(unique); // unique is ['a', 1, 2, '1']



Thanks to Camilo Martin for hint in comment.
ES6 has a native object Set to store unique values. To get an array with unique values you could do now this:


var myArray = ['a', 1, 'a', 2, '1'];

let unique = [...new Set(myArray)];

console.log(unique); // unique is ['a', 1, 2, '1']



The constructor of Set takes an iterable object, like Array, and the spread operator ... transform the set back into an Array. Thanks to Lukas Liese for hint in comment.

Updated answer for ES6/ES2015: Using the Set, the single line solution is:
var items = [4,5,4,6,3,4,5,2,23,1,4,4,4]
var uniqueItems = Array.from(new Set(items))

Which returns 
[4, 5, 6, 3, 2, 23, 1]

As le_m suggested, this can also be shortened using spread operator , like

Edit:
Here is a viable replacement for jQuery ready
function ready(callback){
    // in case the document is already rendered
    if (document.readyState!='loading') callback();
    // modern browsers
    else if (document.addEventListener) document.addEventListener('DOMContentLoaded', callback);

    else document.attachEvent('onreadystatechange', function(){
        if (document.readyState=='complete') callback();

    var ReadyObj = {

        // the ready event fires. See #6781

    ready(function(){

I am not sure how functional this code is, but it worked fine with my superficial tests. This took quite a while, so I hope you and others can benefit from it.
PS.: I suggest compiling it.
Or you can use http://dustindiaz.com/smallest-domready-ever:
function r(f){/in/.test(document.readyState)?setTimeout(r,9,f):f()}
r(function(){/*code to run*/});

or the native function if you only need to support the new browsers (Unlike jQuery ready, this won't run if you add this after the page has loaded)
document.addEventListener('DOMContentLoaded',function(){/*fun code to run*/})

In the following method definitions, what does the * and ** do for param2?
def foo(param1, *param2):
def bar(param1, **param2):

","779,081",2501,1047,python syntax parameter-passing variadic-functions argument-unpacking ,https://stackoverflow.com/questions/36901/what-does-double-star-asterisk-and-star-asterisk-do-for-parameters,22,"
The *args and **kwargs is a common idiom to allow arbitrary number of arguments to functions as described in the section more on defining functions in the Python documentation.
The *args will give you all function parameters as a tuple:
def foo(*args):
    for a in args:
        print(a)        

foo(1)
# 1

foo(1,2,3)
# 1
# 2
# 3

The **kwargs will give you all 
keyword arguments except for those corresponding to a formal parameter as a dictionary.
def bar(**kwargs):
    for a in kwargs:
        print(a, kwargs[a])  

bar(name='one', age=27)
# age 27
# name one

Both idioms can be mixed with normal arguments to allow a set of fixed and some variable arguments:
def foo(kind, *args, **kwargs):
   pass

It is also possible to use this the other way around:
def foo(a, b, c):
    print(a, b, c)

obj = {'b':10, 'c':'lee'}

foo(100,**obj)
# 100 10 lee

Another usage of the *l idiom is to unpack argument lists when calling a function.
def foo(bar, lee):
    print(bar, lee)

l = [1,2]

foo(*l)
# 1 2

In Python 3 it is possible to use *l on the left side of an assignment (Extended Iterable Unpacking), though it gives a list instead of a tuple in this context:
first, *rest = [1,2,3,4]
first, *l, last = [1,2,3,4]

Also Python 3 adds new semantic (refer PEP 3102):
def func(arg1, arg2, arg3, *, kwarg1, kwarg2):
    pass

Such function accepts only 3 positional arguments, and everything after * can only be passed as keyword arguments.
",2380,"
It's also worth noting that you can use * and ** when calling functions as well. This is a shortcut that allows you to pass multiple arguments to a function directly using either a list/tuple or a dictionary. For example, if you have the following function:
def foo(x,y,z):
    print(""x="" + str(x))
    print(""y="" + str(y))
    print(""z="" + str(z))

You can do things like:
>>> mylist = [1,2,3]
>>> foo(*mylist)
x=1
y=2
z=3

>>> mydict = {'x':1,'y':2,'z':3}
>>> foo(**mydict)
x=1
y=2
z=3

>>> mytuple = (1, 2, 3)
>>> foo(*mytuple)
x=1
y=2
z=3

Note: The keys in mydict have to be named exactly like the parameters of function foo. Otherwise it will throw a TypeError:
>>> mydict = {'x':1,'y':2,'z':3,'badnews':9}
>>> foo(**mydict)
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File ""<stdin>"", line 1, in <module>
TypeError: foo() got an unexpected keyword argument 'badnews'

23,3397113,1457849,How to remove the border highlight on an input text element,"
When an HTML element is 'focused' (currently selected/tabbed into), many browsers (at least Safari and Chrome) will put a blue border around it.
For the layout I am working on, this is distracting and does not look right.
<input type=""text"" name=""user"" class=""middle"" id=""user"" tabindex=""1"" />

Firefox does not seem to do this, or at least, will let me control it with:
border: x;

If someone can tell me how IE performs, I would be curious. 
Getting Safari to remove this little bit of flare would be nice.

In your case, try:

}

Or in general, to affect all basic form elements:
input:focus,
select:focus,
textarea:focus,
button:focus {
    outline: none;
}


In the comments, Noah Whitmore suggested taking this even further to support elements that have the contenteditable attribute set to true (effectively making them a type of input element). The following should target those as well (in CSS3 capable browsers):
[contenteditable=""true""]:focus {
    outline: none;
}

Although I wouldn't recommend it, for completeness' sake, you could always disable the focus outline on everything with this:
*:focus {
    outline: none;
}

Keep in mind that the focus outline is an accessibility and usability feature; it clues the user into what element is currently focused.

Here crlf = win-style end-of-line marker, lf = unix-style (and mac osx).
(pre-osx cr in not affected for any of three options above)
When does this warning show up (under Windows)
    –  autocrlf = true if you have unix-style lf in one of your files (= RARELY),
    –  autocrlf = input if you have win-style crlf in one of your files (= almost ALWAYS),
    –  autocrlf = false – NEVER!
What does this warning mean
The warning ""LF will be replaced by CRLF"" says that you (having autocrlf=true) will lose your unix-style LF after commit-checkout cycle (it will be replaced by windows-style CRLF). Git doesn't expect you to use unix-style LF under windows.
The warning ""CRLF will be replaced by LF"" says that you (having autocrlf=input) will lose your windows-style CRLF after a commit-checkout cycle (it will be replaced by unix-style LF). Don't use input under windows.
Yet another way to show how autocrlf works
1) true:             x -> LF -> CRLF
2) input:            x -> LF -> LF
3) false:            x -> x -> x

where x is either CRLF (windows-style) or LF (unix-style) and arrows stand for
file to commit -> repository -> checked out file

How to fix
Default value for core.autocrlf is selected during git installation and stored in system-wide gitconfig (%ProgramFiles(x86)%\git\etc\gitconfig).  Also there're (cascading in the following order):
    – ""global"" (per-user) gitconfig located at ~/.gitconfig, yet another
    – ""global"" (per-user) gitconfig at $XDG_CONFIG_HOME/git/config or $HOME/.config/git/config and
    – ""local"" (per-repo) gitconfig at .git/config in the working dir.
So, write git config core.autocrlf in the working dir to check the currently used value and
    – add autocrlf=false to system-wide gitconfig            # per-system solution
    – git config --global core.autocrlf false                # per-user solution
    – git config --local core.autocrlf false                  # per-project solution
Warnings
– git config settings can be overridden by gitattributes settings.
– crlf -> lf conversion only happens when adding new files, crlf files already existing in the repo aren't affected.
Moral (for Windows):
    -  use core.autocrlf = true if you plan to use this project under Unix as well (and unwilling to configure your editor/IDE to use unix line endings),
    -  use core.autocrlf = false if you plan to use this project under Windows only (or you have configured your editor/IDE to use unix line endings),
    -  never use core.autocrlf = input unless you have a good reason to (eg if you're using unix utilities under windows or if you run into makefiles issues),
PS What to choose when installing git for Windows?
If you're not going to use any of your projects under Unix, don't agree with the default first option. Choose the third one (Checkout as-is, commit as-is). You won't see this message. Ever.
PPS My personal preference is configuring the editor/IDE to use Unix-style endings, and setting core.autocrlf to false.

For anyone interested in reading more about it, Stack Overflow user kangax has written an incredibly in-depth blog post about the delete statement on their blog, Understanding delete. It is highly recommended.
",8520,"
Objects in JavaScript can be thought of as maps between keys and values. The delete operator is used to remove these keys, more commonly known as object properties, one at a time.


var obj = {
  myProperty: 1    
}
console.log(obj.hasOwnProperty('myProperty')) // true
delete obj.myProperty
console.log(obj.hasOwnProperty('myProperty')) // false



The delete operator does not directly free memory, and it differs from simply assigning the value of null or undefined to a property, in that the property itself is removed from the object. Note that if the value of a deleted property was a reference type (an object), and another part of your program still holds a reference to that object, then that object will, of course, not be garbage collected until all references to it have disappeared.
delete will only work on properties whose descriptor marks them as configurable.

Modern browsers have Array#includes, which does exactly that and is widely supported by everyone except IE:


console.log(['joe', 'jane', 'mary'].includes('jane')); //true



For internet explorer you can use below function to check an array include a value:


function includes(container, value) {
    var returnValue = false;
    var pos = container.indexOf(value);
    if (pos >= 0) {
        returnValue = true;
    }
    return returnValue;
}
//examples---------
console.log(includes([1,2,3],2))
console.log(includes([1,2,3],'a'))
console.log(includes(""abc"",'a'))
console.log(includes(""abc"",'e'))



You can also use Array#indexOf, which is less direct, but doesn't require polyfills for outdated browsers.

Many frameworks also offer similar methods:

jQuery: $.inArray(value, array, [fromIndex])
Underscore.js: _.contains(array, value) (also aliased as _.include and _.includes)
Dojo Toolkit: dojo.indexOf(array, value, [fromIndex, findLast])
Prototype: array.indexOf(value)
MooTools: array.indexOf(value)
MochiKit: findValue(array, value)
MS Ajax: array.indexOf(value)
Ext: Ext.Array.contains(array, value)
Lodash: _.includes(array, value, [from]) (is _.contains prior 4.0.0)
Ramda: R.includes(value, array)

Notice that some frameworks implement this as a function, while others add the function to the array prototype.
",4567,"
Update from 2019: This answer is from 2008 (11 years old!) and is not relevant for modern JS usage. The promised performance improvement was based on a benchmark done in browsers of that time. It might not be relevant to modern JS execution contexts. If you need an easy solution, look for other answers. If you need the best performance, benchmark for yourself in the relevant execution environments.
As others have said, the iteration through the array is probably the best way, but it has been proven that a decreasing while loop is the fastest way to iterate in JavaScript. So you may want to rewrite your code as follows:
function contains(a, obj) {
    var i = a.length;
    while (i--) {
       if (a[i] === obj) {
           return true;
       }
    }
    return false;
}

Of course, you may as well extend Array prototype:
Array.prototype.contains = function(obj) {
    var i = this.length;
    while (i--) {
        if (this[i] === obj) {
            return true;
        }
    }
    return false;
}

And now you can simply use the following:
alert([1, 2, 3].contains(2)); // => true
alert([1, 2, 3].contains('2')); // => false

<gradient android:startColor=""#b4555555"" android:endColor=""#b4555555""
 android:angle=""270.0"" />

If I remove the last two characters (55) I get a solid color, losing the transparency. I was trying to find a page where I can see some explanation about this, but I couldn't find it. 
","157,653",216,192,android colors hex transparency ,https://stackoverflow.com/questions/5445085/understanding-colors-on-android-six-characters,8,"
If you provide 6 hex digits, that means RGB (2 hex digits for each value of red, green and blue).
If you provide 8 hex digits, it's an ARGB (2 hex digits for each value of alpha, red, green and blue respectively).
So by removing the final 55 you're changing from A=B4, R=55, G=55, B=55 (a mostly transparent grey), to R=B4, G=55, B=55 (a fully-non-transparent dusky pinky).
See the ""Color"" documentation for the supported formats.
",172,"
Android uses hexadecimal ARGB values, which are formatted as #AARRGGBB. That first pair of letters, the AA, represent the alpha channel. You must convert your decimal opacity values to a hexadecimal value. Here are the steps:
Alpha Hex Value Process

Take your opacity as a decimal value and multiply it by 255. So, if you have a block that is 50% opaque the decimal value would be .5. For example: .5 x 255 = 127.5
The fraction won't convert to hexadecimal, so you must round your number up or down to the nearest whole number. For example: 127.5 rounds up to 128; 55.25 rounds down to 55.
Enter your decimal value in a decimal-to-hexadecimal converter, like http://www.binaryhexconverter.com/decimal-to-hex-converter, and convert your values.
If you only get back a single value, prefix it with a zero. For example, if you're trying to get 5% opacity and you're going through this process, you'll end up with the hexadecimal value of D. Add a zero in front of it so it appears as 0D.

That's how you find the alpha channel value. I've taken the liberty to put together a list of values for you. Enjoy!

I'm really confused by the answers that have been given - most of them are just outright incorrect. Of course you can have object properties that have undefined, null, or false values. So simply reducing the property check to typeof this[property] or, even worse, x.key will give you completely misleading results.
It depends on what you're looking for. If you want to know if an object physically contains a property (and it is not coming from somewhere up on the prototype chain) then object.hasOwnProperty is the way to go. All modern browsers support it. (It was missing in older versions of Safari - 2.0.1 and older - but those versions of the browser are rarely used any more.)
If what you're looking for is if an object has a property on it that is iterable (when you iterate over the properties of the object, it will appear) then doing: prop in object will give you your desired effect.
Since using hasOwnProperty is probably what you want, and considering that you may want a fallback method, I present to you the following solution:
var obj = {
    a: undefined,
    b: null,
    c: false
};

// a, b, c all found
for ( var prop in obj ) {
    document.writeln( ""Object1: "" + prop );
}

function Class(){
    this.a = undefined;
    this.b = null;
    this.c = false;
}

Class.prototype = {
    a: undefined,
    b: true,
    c: true,
    d: true,
    e: true
};

var obj2 = new Class();

// a, b, c, d, e found
for ( var prop in obj2 ) {
    document.writeln( ""Object2: "" + prop );
}

function hasOwnProperty(obj, prop) {
    var proto = obj.__proto__ || obj.constructor.prototype;
    return (prop in obj) &&
        (!(prop in proto) || proto[prop] !== obj[prop]);
}

if ( Object.prototype.hasOwnProperty ) {
    var hasOwnProperty = function(obj, prop) {
        return obj.hasOwnProperty(prop);
    }
}

// a, b, c found in modern browsers
// b, c found in Safari 2.0.1 and older
for ( var prop in obj2 ) {
    if ( hasOwnProperty(obj2, prop) ) {
        document.writeln( ""Object2 w/ hasOwn: "" + prop );
    }
}

The above is a working, cross-browser, solution to hasOwnProperty, with one caveat: It is unable to distinguish between cases where an identical property is on the prototype and on the instance - it just assumes that it's coming from the prototype. You could shift it to be more lenient or strict, based upon your situation, but at the very least this should be more helpful.
",1453,"
With Underscore.js or (even better) Lodash:
_.has(x, 'key');

Which calls Object.prototype.hasOwnProperty, but (a) is shorter to type, and (b) uses ""a safe reference to hasOwnProperty"" (i.e. it works even if hasOwnProperty is overwritten).
In particular, Lodash defines _.has as:
   function has(object, key) {
      return object ? hasOwnProperty.call(object, key) : false;
   }
   // hasOwnProperty = Object.prototype.hasOwnProperty

Words of Warning (update)
REMOTE_ADDR still represents the most reliable source of an IP address. The other $_SERVER variables mentioned here can be spoofed by a remote client very easily. The purpose of this solution is to attempt to determine the IP address of a client sitting behind a proxy. For your general purposes, you might consider using this in combination with the IP address returned directly from $_SERVER['REMOTE_ADDR'] and storing both.
For 99.9% of users this solution will suit your needs perfectly. It will not protect you from the 0.1% of malicious users looking to abuse your system by injecting their own request headers. If relying on IP addresses for something mission critical, resort to REMOTE_ADDR and don't bother catering to those behind a proxy.

Here is a shorter, cleaner way to get the IP address:
function get_ip_address(){
    foreach (array('HTTP_CLIENT_IP', 'HTTP_X_FORWARDED_FOR', 'HTTP_X_FORWARDED', 'HTTP_X_CLUSTER_CLIENT_IP', 'HTTP_FORWARDED_FOR', 'HTTP_FORWARDED', 'REMOTE_ADDR') as $key){
        if (array_key_exists($key, $_SERVER) === true){
            foreach (explode(',', $_SERVER[$key]) as $ip){
                $ip = trim($ip); // just to be safe

                if (filter_var($ip, FILTER_VALIDATE_IP, FILTER_FLAG_NO_PRIV_RANGE | FILTER_FLAG_NO_RES_RANGE) !== false){
                    return $ip;
                }
            }
        }
    }
}


Your code seems to be pretty complete already, I cannot see any possible bugs in it (aside from the usual IP caveats), I would change the validate_ip() function to rely on the filter extension though:
public function validate_ip($ip)
{
    if (filter_var($ip, FILTER_VALIDATE_IP, FILTER_FLAG_NO_PRIV_RANGE | FILTER_FLAG_NO_RES_RANGE) === false)
    {
        return false;
    }

    self::$ip = sprintf('%u', ip2long($ip)); // you seem to want this

    return true;
}

Also your HTTP_X_FORWARDED_FOR snippet can be simplified from this:
// check for IPs passing through proxies
if (!empty($_SERVER['HTTP_X_FORWARDED_FOR']))
{
    // check if multiple ips exist in var
    if (strpos($_SERVER['HTTP_X_FORWARDED_FOR'], ',') !== false)
    {
        $iplist = explode(',', $_SERVER['HTTP_X_FORWARDED_FOR']);
        
        foreach ($iplist as $ip)
        {
            if ($this->validate_ip($ip))
                return $ip;
        }
    }
    
    else
    {
        if ($this->validate_ip($_SERVER['HTTP_X_FORWARDED_FOR']))
            return $_SERVER['HTTP_X_FORWARDED_FOR'];
    }
}

To this:
// check for IPs passing through proxies
if (!empty($_SERVER['HTTP_X_FORWARDED_FOR']))
{
    $iplist = explode(',', $_SERVER['HTTP_X_FORWARDED_FOR']);
        
    foreach ($iplist as $ip)
    {
        if ($this->validate_ip($ip))
            return $ip;
    }
}

You may also want to validate IPv6 addresses.
",282,"
Even then however, getting a user's real IP address is going to be unreliable. All they need to do is use an anonymous proxy server (one that doesn't honor the headers for http_x_forwarded_for, http_forwarded, etc) and all you get is their proxy server's IP address.
You can then see if there is a list of proxy server IP addresses that are anonymous, but there is no way to be sure that is 100% accurate as well and the most it'd do is let you know it is a proxy server. And if someone is being clever, they can spoof headers for HTTP forwards.
Let's say I don't like the local college. I figure out what IP addresses they registered, and get their IP address banned on your site by doing bad things, because I figure out you honor the HTTP forwards. The list is endless.

  margin: -60px 0 0; /* negative fixed header height */

33,1068834,201183,How to determine equality for two JavaScript objects?,"
A strict equality operator will tell you if two object types are equal. However, is there a way to tell if two objects are equal, much like the hash code value in Java?
Stack Overflow question Is there any kind of hashCode function in JavaScript? is similar to this question, but requires a more academic answer. The scenario above demonstrates why it would be necessary to have one, and I'm wondering if there is any equivalent solution.
","532,881",715,154,javascript object equals hashcode ,https://stackoverflow.com/questions/201183/how-to-determine-equality-for-two-javascript-objects,64,"
The short answer
The simple answer is: No, there is no generic means to determine that an object is equal to another in the sense you mean. The exception is when you are strictly thinking of an object being typeless.
The long answer
The concept is that of an Equals method that compares two different instances of an object to indicate whether they are equal at a value level. However, it is up to the specific type to define how an Equals method should be implemented. An iterative comparison of attributes that have primitive values may not be enough, there may well be attributes which are not to be considered part of the object value. For example,
 function MyClass(a, b)
 {
     var c;
     this.getCLazy = function() {
         if (c === undefined) c = a * b // imagine * is really expensive
         return c;
     }
  }

In this above case, c is not really important to determine whether any two instances of MyClass are equal, only a and b are important. In some cases c might vary between instances and yet not be significant during comparison. 
Note this issue applies when members may themselves also be instances of a type and these each would all be required to have a means of determining equality.
Further complicating things is that in JavaScript the distinction between data and method is blurred.
An object may reference a method that is to be called as an event handler, and this would likely not be considered part of its 'value state'. Whereas another object may well be assigned a function that performs an important calculation and thereby makes this instance different from others simply because it references a different function.
What about an object that has one of its existing prototype methods overridden by another function? Could it still be considered equal to another instance that it otherwise identical? That question can only be answered in each specific case for each type.
As stated earlier, the exception would be a strictly typeless object. In which case the only sensible choice is an iterative and recursive comparison of each member. Even then one has to ask what is the 'value' of a function?
",188,"
Why reinvent the wheel? Give Lodash a try. It has a number of must-have functions such as isEqual().
_.isEqual(object, other);

It will brute force check each key value - just like the other examples on this page - using ECMAScript 5 and native optimizations if they're available in the browser.
Note: Previously this answer recommended Underscore.js, but lodash has done a better job of getting bugs fixed and addressing issues with consistency.

{ thetop : 10 } is a valid object literal.  The code will create an object with a property named thetop that has a value of 10.  Both the following are the same:
obj = { thetop : 10 };
obj = { ""thetop"" : 10 };

In ES5 and earlier, you cannot use a variable as a property name inside an object literal.  Your only option is to do the following:
var thetop = ""top"";

// create the object literal
var aniArgs = {};

// Assign the variable property name with a value of 10
aniArgs[thetop] = 10; 

// Pass the resulting object to the animate method
<something>.stop().animate(
    aniArgs, 10  
);  

ES6 defines ComputedPropertyName as part of the grammar for object literals, which allows you to write the code like this:
var thetop = ""top"",
    obj = { [thetop]: 10 };

console.log(obj.top); // -> 10

Where key can be any sort of expression (e.g. a variable) returning a value.
So here your code would look like:

Find the index of the array element you want to remove using indexOf, and then remove that index with splice.

The splice() method changes the contents of an array by removing
  existing elements and/or adding new elements.



const array = [2, 5, 9];

console.log(array);

const index = array.indexOf(5);
if (index > -1) {
  array.splice(index, 1);
}

// array = [2, 9]
console.log(array); 



The second parameter of splice is the number of elements to remove. Note that splice modifies the array in place and returns a new array containing the elements that have been removed.

For the reason of completeness, here are functions. The first function removes only a single occurrence (i.e. removing the first match of 5 from [2,5,9,1,5,8,5]), while the second function removes all occurrences:


function removeItemOnce(arr, value) {
  var index = arr.indexOf(value);
  if (index > -1) {
    arr.splice(index, 1);
  }
  return arr;
}

function removeItemAll(arr, value) {
  var i = 0;
  while (i < arr.length) {
    if (arr[i] === value) {
      arr.splice(i, 1);
    } else {
      ++i;
    }
  }
  return arr;
}
//Usage
console.log(removeItemOnce([2,5,9,1,5,8,5], 5))
console.log(removeItemAll([2,5,9,1,5,8,5], 5))

I don't know how you are expecting array.remove(int) to behave. There are three possibilities I can think of that you might want.
To remove an element of an array at an index i:
array.splice(i, 1);

If you want to remove every element with value number from the array:
for (var i = array.length - 1; i >= 0; i--) {
 if (array[i] === number) {
  array.splice(i, 1);
 }
}

If you just want to make the element at index i no longer exist, but you don't want the indexes of the other elements to change:
delete array[i];

Depending upon the design being produced, each of the below clearfix CSS solutions has its own benefits.
The clearfix does have useful applications but it has also been used as a hack. Before you use a clearfix perhaps these modern css solutions can be useful:

css flexbox
css grid


Modern Clearfix Solutions

Container with overflow: auto;
The simplest way to clear floated elements is using the style overflow: auto on the containing element. This solution works in every modern browsers.
<div style=""overflow: auto;"">
  <img
    style=""float: right;""
    src=""path/to/floated-element.png""
    width=""500""
    height=""500""
  > 
  <p>Your content here…</p>
</div>

One downside, using certain combinations of margin and padding on the external element can cause scrollbars to appear but this can be solved by placing the margin and padding on another parent containing element.
Using ‘overflow: hidden’ is also a clearfix solution, but will not have scrollbars, however using hidden will crop any content positioned outside of the containing element.
Note: The floated element is an img tag in this example, but could be any html element.

Clearfix Reloaded
Thierry Koblentz on CSSMojo wrote: The very latest clearfix reloaded. He noted that by dropping support for oldIE, the solution can be simplified to one css statement. Additionally, using display: block (instead of display: table) allows margins to collapse properly when elements with clearfix are siblings.
.container::after {
  content: """";
  display: block;
  clear: both;
}

This is the most modern version of the clearfix.

""Beat That ClearFix"", a clearfix for modern browsers
Thierry Koblentz' of CSS Mojo has pointed out that when targeting modern browsers, we can now drop the zoom and ::before property/values and simply use:
.container::after {
    content: """";
    display: table;
    clear: both;
}

This solution does not support for IE 6/7 …on purpose!
Thierry also offers: ""A word of caution: if you start a new project from scratch, go for it, but don’t swap this technique with the one you have now, because even though you do not support oldIE, your existing rules prevent collapsing margins.""

Micro Clearfix
The most recent and globally adopted clearfix solution, the Micro Clearfix by Nicolas Gallagher.
Known support: Firefox 3.5+, Safari 4+, Chrome, Opera 9+, IE 6+
.container::before, .container::after {
  content: """";
  display: table;
}
.container::after {
  clear: both;
}
.container {
  zoom: 1;
}


Overflow Property
This basic method is preferred for the usual case, when positioned content will not show outside the bounds of the container.
http://www.quirksmode.org/css/clearing.html
- explains how to resolve common issues related to this technique, namely, setting width: 100% on the container.
.container {
  overflow: hidden;
  display: inline-block;
  display: block;
}

Rather than using the display property to set ""hasLayout"" for IE, other properties can be used for triggering ""hasLayout"" for an element.
.container {
  overflow: hidden;
  zoom: 1;
  display: block;
}

Another way to clear floats using the overflow property is to use the underscore hack. IE will apply the values prefixed with the underscore, other browsers will not. The zoom property triggers hasLayout in IE:
.container {
  overflow: hidden;
  _overflow: visible; /* for IE */
  _zoom: 1; /* for IE */
}

While this works... it is not ideal to use hacks.

PIE: Easy Clearing Method
This older ""Easy Clearing"" method has the advantage of allowing positioned elements to hang outside the bounds of the container, at the expense of more tricky CSS.
This solution is quite old, but you can learn all about Easy Clearing on Position Is Everything: http://www.positioniseverything.net/easyclearing.html

Element using ""clear"" property
The quick and dirty solution (with some drawbacks) for when you’re quickly slapping something together:
<br style=""clear: both"" /> <!-- So dirty! -->

Drawbacks

It's not responsive and thus may not provide the desired effect if layout styles change based upon media queries. A solution in pure CSS is more ideal.
It adds html markup without necessarily adding any semantic value.
It requires a inline definition and solution for each instance rather than a class reference to a single solution of a “clearfix” in the css and class references to it in the html.
It makes code difficult to work with for others as they may have to write more hacks to work around it.
In the future when you need/want to use another clearfix solution, you won't have to go back and remove every <br style=""clear: both"" /> tag littered around the markup.

",1046,"
What problems are we trying to solve?
There are two important considerations when floating stuff:

Containing descendant floats. This means that the element in question makes itself tall enough to wrap all floating descendants. (They don't hang outside.)

Insulating descendants from outside floats. This means that descendants inside of an element should be able to use clear: both and have it not interact with floats outside the element.


Block formatting contexts
There's only one way to do both of these. And that is to establish a new block formatting context. Elements that establish a block formatting context are an insulated rectangle in which floats interact with each other. A block formatting context will always be tall enough to visually wrap its floating descendants, and no floats outside of a block formatting context may interact with elements inside. This two-way insulation is exactly what you want. In IE, this same concept is called hasLayout, which can be set via zoom: 1.
There are several ways to establish a block formatting context, but the solution I recommend is display: inline-block with width: 100%. (Of course, there are the usual caveats with using width: 100%, so use box-sizing: border-box or put padding, margin, and border on a different element.)
The most robust solution
Probably the most common application of floats is the two-column layout. (Can be extended to three columns.)
First the markup structure.
<div class=""container"">
  <div class=""sidebar"">
    sidebar<br/>sidebar<br/>sidebar
  </div>
  <div class=""main"">
    <div class=""main-content"">
      main content
      <span style=""clear: both"">
        main content that uses <code>clear: both</code>
      </span>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

And now the CSS.
/* Should contain all floated and non-floated content, so it needs to
 * establish a new block formatting context without using overflow: hidden.
 */
.container {
  display: inline-block;
  width: 100%;
  zoom: 1; /* new block formatting context via hasLayout for IE 6/7 */
}

/* Fixed-width floated sidebar. */
.sidebar {
  float: left;
  width: 160px;
}

/* Needs to make space for the sidebar. */
.main {
  margin-left: 160px;
}

/* Establishes a new block formatting context to insulate descendants from
 * the floating sidebar. */
.main-content {
  display: inline-block;
  width: 100%;
  zoom: 1; /* new block formatting context via hasLayout for IE 6/7 */
}

Try it yourself
Go to JS Bin to play around with the code and see how this solution is built from the ground up.
Traditional clearfix methods considered harmful
The problem with the traditional clearfix solutions is that they use two different rendering concepts to achieve the same goal for IE and everyone else. In IE they use hasLayout to establish a new block formatting context, but for everyone else they use generated boxes (:after) with clear: both, which does not establish a new block formatting context. This means things won't behave the same in all situations. For an explanation of why this is bad, see Everything you Know about Clearfix is Wrong.

This depends a lot on what you mean by ""revert"".
Temporarily switch to a different commit
If you want to temporarily go back to it, fool around, then come back to where you are, all you have to do is check out the desired commit:
# This will detach your HEAD, that is, leave you with no branch checked out:
git checkout 0d1d7fc32

Or if you want to make commits while you're there, go ahead and make a new branch while you're at it:
git checkout -b old-state 0d1d7fc32

To go back to where you were, just check out the branch you were on again. (If you've made changes, as always when switching branches, you'll have to deal with them as appropriate. You could reset to throw them away; you could stash, checkout, stash pop to take them with you; you could commit them to a branch there if you want a branch there.)
Hard delete unpublished commits
If, on the other hand, you want to really get rid of everything you've done since then, there are two possibilities. One, if you haven't published any of these commits, simply reset:
# This will destroy any local modifications.
# Don't do it if you have uncommitted work you want to keep.
git reset --hard 0d1d7fc32

# Alternatively, if there's work to keep:
git stash
git reset --hard 0d1d7fc32
git stash pop
# This saves the modifications, then reapplies that patch after resetting.
# You could get merge conflicts, if you've modified things which were
# changed since the commit you reset to.

If you mess up, you've already thrown away your local changes, but you can at least get back to where you were before by resetting again.
Undo published commits with new commits
On the other hand, if you've published the work, you probably don't want to reset the branch, since that's effectively rewriting history. In that case, you could indeed revert the commits. With Git, revert has a very specific meaning: create a commit with the reverse patch to cancel it out. This way you don't rewrite any history.
# This will create three separate revert commits:
git revert a867b4af 25eee4ca 0766c053

# It also takes ranges. This will revert the last two commits:
git revert HEAD~2..HEAD

#Similarly, you can revert a range of commits using commit hashes (non inclusive of first hash):
git revert 0d1d7fc..a867b4a

# Reverting a merge commit
git revert -m 1 <merge_commit_sha>

# To get just one, you could use `rebase -i` to squash them afterwards
# Or, you could do it manually (be sure to do this at top level of the repo)
# get your index and work tree into the desired state, without changing HEAD:
git checkout 0d1d7fc32 .

# Then commit. Be sure and write a good message describing what you just did
git commit

The git-revert manpage actually covers a lot of this in its description. Another useful link is this git-scm.com section discussing git-revert.
If you decide you didn't want to revert after all, you can revert the revert (as described here) or reset back to before the revert (see the previous section).
You may also find this answer helpful in this case:
How can I move HEAD back to a previous location? (Detached head) & Undo commits
",10140,"
Lots of complicated and dangerous answers here, but it's actually easy:
git revert --no-commit 0766c053..HEAD
git commit

This will revert everything from the HEAD back to the commit hash, meaning it will recreate that commit state in the working tree as if every commit after 0766c053 had been walked back. You can then commit the current tree, and it will create a brand new commit essentially equivalent to the commit you ""reverted"" to.  
(The --no-commit flag lets git revert all the commits at once- otherwise you'll be prompted for a message for each commit in the range, littering your history with unnecessary new commits.)
This is a safe and easy way to rollback to a previous state. No history is destroyed, so it can be used for commits that have already been made public.

This command is responsible for the undo. It will undo your last commit while leaving your working tree (the state of your files on disk) untouched. You'll need to add them again before you can commit them again).

Make corrections to working tree files.

git add anything that you want to include in your new commit.

Commit the changes, reusing the old commit message. reset copied the old head to .git/ORIG_HEAD; commit with -c ORIG_HEAD will open an editor, which initially contains the log message from the old commit and allows you to edit it. If you do not need to edit the message, you could use the -C option.


Alternatively, to edit the previous commit (or just its commit message), commit --amend will add changes within the current index to the previous commit.
To remove (not revert) a commit that has been pushed to the server, rewriting history with git push origin master --force is necessary.

Further Reading
How can I move HEAD back to a previous location? (Detached head) & Undo commits
The above answer will show you git reflog, which you can use to determine the SHA-1 for the commit to which you wish to revert. Once you have this value, use the sequence of commands as explained above.

HEAD~ is the same as HEAD~1. The article What is the HEAD in git? is helpful if you want to uncommit multiple commits.
",23678,"
Undoing a commit is a little scary if you don't know how it works.  But it's actually amazingly easy if you do understand. I'll show you the 4 different ways you can undo a commit.
option 1: git reset --hard
Say you have this, where C is your HEAD and (F) is the state of your files.
   (F)
A-B-C
    ↑
  master

You want to nuke commit C and never see it again and lose all the changes in locally modified files.  You do this:
git reset --hard HEAD~1

The result is:
 (F)
A-B
  ↑
master

Now B is the HEAD.  Because you used --hard, your files are reset to their state at commit B.
option 2: git reset
Ah, but suppose commit C wasn't a disaster, but just a bit off.  You want to undo the commit but keep your changes for a bit of editing before you do a better commit.  Starting again from here, with C as your HEAD:
   (F)
A-B-C
    ↑
  master

You can do this, leaving off the --hard:
git reset HEAD~1

In this case the result is:
   (F)
A-B-C
  ↑
master

In both cases, HEAD is just a pointer to the latest commit.  When you do a git reset HEAD~1, you tell Git to move the HEAD pointer back one commit.  But (unless you use --hard) you leave your files as they were.  So now git status shows the changes you had checked into C.  You haven't lost a thing!
option 3: git reset --soft
For the lightest touch, you can even undo your commit but leave your files and your index:
git reset --soft HEAD~1

This not only leaves your files alone, it even leaves your index alone.  When you do git status, you'll see that the same files are in the index as before.  In fact, right after this command, you could do git commit and you'd be redoing the same commit you just had.
option 4: you did git reset --hard and need to get that code back
One more thing: Suppose you destroy a commit as in the first example, but then discover you needed it after all?  Tough luck, right?
Nope, there's still a way to get it back.  Type git reflog and you'll see a list of (partial) commit shas (that is, hashes) that you've moved around in.  Find the commit you destroyed, and do this:
git checkout -b someNewBranchName shaYouDestroyed

You've now resurrected that commit.  Commits don't actually get destroyed in Git for some 90 days, so you can usually go back and rescue one you didn't mean to get rid of.

If Python does not have a ternary conditional operator, is it possible to simulate one using other language constructs?
","2,003,207",6306,923,python operators ternary-operator conditional-operator ,https://stackoverflow.com/questions/394809/does-python-have-a-ternary-conditional-operator,26,"
Yes, it was added in version 2.5. The expression syntax is:
a if condition else b

First condition is evaluated, then exactly one of either a or b is evaluated and returned based on the Boolean value of condition. If condition evaluates to True, then a is evaluated and returned but b is ignored, or else when b is evaluated and returned but a is ignored.
This allows short-circuiting because when condition is true only a is evaluated and b is not evaluated at all, but when condition is false only b is evaluated and a is not evaluated at all.
For example:
>>> 'true' if True else 'false'
'true'
>>> 'true' if False else 'false'
'false'

Note that conditionals are an expression, not a statement. This means you can't use assignment statements or pass or other statements within a conditional expression:
>>> pass if False else x = 3
  File ""<stdin>"", line 1
    pass if False else x = 3
          ^
SyntaxError: invalid syntax

You can, however, use conditional expressions to assign a variable like so:
x = a if True else b

Think of the conditional expression as switching between two values. It is very useful when you're in a 'one value or another' situation, it but doesn't do much else.
If you need to use statements, you have to use a normal if statement instead of a conditional expression.

Keep in mind that it's frowned upon by some Pythonistas for several reasons:

The order of the arguments is different from those of the classic condition ? a : b ternary operator from many other languages (such as C, C++, Go, Perl, Ruby, Java, Javascript, etc.), which may lead to bugs when people unfamiliar with Python's ""surprising"" behaviour use it (they may reverse the argument order).
Some find it ""unwieldy"", since it goes contrary to the normal flow of thought (thinking of the condition first and then the effects).
Stylistic reasons. (Although the 'inline if' can be really useful, and make your script more concise, it really does complicate your code)

If you're having trouble remembering the order, then remember that when read aloud, you (almost) say what you mean. For example, x = 4 if b > 8 else 9 is read aloud as x will be 4 if b is greater than 8 otherwise 9.
Official documentation:

What is the best way to check whether a given object is of a given type? How about checking whether the object inherits from a given type?
Let's say I have an object o. How do I check whether it's a str?
","933,852",1348,286,python types ,https://stackoverflow.com/questions/152580/whats-the-canonical-way-to-check-for-type-in-python,13,"
To check if o is an instance of str or any subclass of str, use isinstance (this would be the ""canonical"" way):
if isinstance(o, str):

To check if the type of o is exactly str (exclude subclasses):
if type(o) is str:

The following also works, and can be useful in some cases:
if issubclass(type(o), str):

See Built-in Functions in the Python Library Reference for relevant information.
One more note: in this case, if you're using Python 2, you may actually want to use:
if isinstance(o, basestring):

because this will also catch Unicode strings (unicode is not a subclass of str; both str and unicode are subclasses of basestring). Note that basestring no longer exists in Python 3, where there's a strict separation of strings (str) and binary data (bytes).
Alternatively, isinstance accepts a tuple of classes. This will return True if o is an instance of any subclass of any of (str, unicode):
if isinstance(o, (str, unicode)):

",1610,"
The most Pythonic way to check the type of an object is... not to check it.
Since Python encourages Duck Typing, you should just try...except to use the object's methods the way you want to use them.  So if your function is looking for a writable file object, don't check that it's a subclass of file, just try to use its .write() method!
Of course, sometimes these nice abstractions break down and isinstance(obj, cls) is what you need.  But use sparingly.

52,1165761,803225,When should I use double instead of decimal?,"
I can name three advantages to using double (or float) instead of decimal:

Uses less memory.
Faster because floating point math operations are natively supported by processors.
Can represent a larger range of numbers.

But these advantages seem to apply only to calculation intensive operations, such as those found in modeling software. Of course, doubles should not be used when precision is required, such as financial calculations. So are there any practical reasons to ever choose double (or float) instead of decimal in ""normal"" applications?
Edited to add:
Thanks for all the great responses, I learned from them.
One further question: A few people made the point that doubles can more precisely represent real numbers. When declared I would think that they usually more accurately represent them as well. But is it a true statement that the accuracy may decrease (sometimes significantly) when floating point operations are performed?
","54,817",272,71,c# types floating-point double decimal ,https://stackoverflow.com/questions/803225/when-should-i-use-double-instead-of-decimal,12,"
I think you've summarised the advantages quite well. You are however missing one point. The decimal type is only more accurate at representing base 10 numbers (e.g. those used in currency/financial calculations). In general, the  double type is going to offer at least as great precision (someone correct me if I'm wrong) and definitely greater speed for arbitrary real numbers. The simple conclusion is: when considering which to use, always use double unless you need the base 10 accuracy that decimal offers.
Edit:
Regarding your additional question about the decrease in accuracy of floating-point numbers after operations, this is a slightly more subtle issue. Indeed, precision (I use the term interchangeably for accuracy here) will steadily decrease after each operation is performed. This is due to two reasons: 

the fact that certain numbers (most obviously decimals) can't be truly represented in floating point form
rounding errors occur, just as if you were doing the calculation by hand. It depends greatly on the context (how many operations you're performing) whether these errors are significant enough to warrant much thought however. 

In all cases, if you want to compare two floating-point numbers that should in theory be equivalent (but were arrived at using different calculations), you need to allow a certain degree of tolerance (how much varies, but is typically very small).
For a more detailed overview of the particular cases where errors in accuracies can be introduced, see the Accuracy section of the Wikipedia article. Finally, if you want a seriously in-depth (and mathematical) discussion of floating-point numbers/operations at machine level, try reading the oft-quoted article What Every Computer Scientist Should Know About Floating-Point Arithmetic.
",310,"
You seem spot on with the benefits of using a floating point type.  I tend to design for decimals in all cases, and rely on a profiler to let me know if operations on decimal is causing bottlenecks or slow-downs.  In those cases, I will ""down cast"" to double or float, but only do it internally, and carefully try to manage precision loss by limiting the number of significant digits in the mathematical operation being performed.
In general, if your value is transient (not reused), you're safe to use a floating point type.  The real problem with floating point types is the following three scenarios.

You are aggregating floating point values (in which case the precision errors compound)
You build values based on the floating point value (for example in a recursive algorithm)
You are doing math with a very wide number of significant digits (for example, 123456789.1 * .000000000000000987654321)

EDIT
According to the reference documentation on C# decimals:

The decimal keyword denotes a
  128-bit data type. Compared to
  floating-point types, the decimal type
  has a greater precision and a smaller
  range, which makes it suitable for
  financial and monetary calculations.

So to clarify my above statement:

I tend to design for decimals in all
  cases, and rely on a profiler to let
  me know if operations on decimal is
  causing bottlenecks or slow-downs.

I have only ever worked in industries where decimals are favorable.  If you're working on phsyics or graphics engines, it's probably much more beneficial to design for a floating point type (float or double).
Decimal is not infinitely precise (it is impossible to represent infinite precision for non-integral in a primitive data type), but it is far more precise than double:

decimal = 28-29 significant digits
double = 15-16 significant digits
float = 7 significant digits

EDIT 2
In response to Konrad Rudolph's comment, item # 1 (above) is definitely correct.  Aggregation of imprecision does indeed compound.  See the below code for an example:
private const float THREE_FIFTHS = 3f / 5f;
private const int ONE_MILLION = 1000000;

public static void Main(string[] args)
{
    Console.WriteLine(""Three Fifths: {0}"", THREE_FIFTHS.ToString(""F10""));
    float asSingle = 0f;
    double asDouble = 0d;
    decimal asDecimal = 0M;

    for (int i = 0; i < ONE_MILLION; i++)
    {
        asSingle += THREE_FIFTHS;
        asDouble += THREE_FIFTHS;
        asDecimal += (decimal) THREE_FIFTHS;
    }
    Console.WriteLine(""Six Hundred Thousand: {0:F10}"", THREE_FIFTHS * ONE_MILLION);
    Console.WriteLine(""Single: {0}"", asSingle.ToString(""F10""));
    Console.WriteLine(""Double: {0}"", asDouble.ToString(""F10""));
    Console.WriteLine(""Decimal: {0}"", asDecimal.ToString(""F10""));
    Console.ReadLine();
}

This outputs the following:
Three Fifths: 0.6000000000
Six Hundred Thousand: 600000.0000000000
Single: 599093.4000000000
Double: 599999.9999886850
Decimal: 600000.0000000000

As you can see, even though we are adding from the same source constant, the results of the double is less precise (although probably will round correctly), and the float is far less precise, to the point where it has been reduced to only two significant digits.

From MDN:

The find() method returns the first value in the array, if an element in the array satisfies the provided testing function. Otherwise undefined is returned.


If you want to find its index instead, use findIndex():

From MDN:

The findIndex() method returns the index of the first element in the array that satisfies the provided testing function. Otherwise -1 is returned.


If you want to get an array of matching elements, use the filter() method instead:
myArray.filter(x => x.id === '45');

This will return an array of objects. If you want to get an array of foo properties, you can do this with the map() method:
myArray.filter(x => x.id === '45').map(x => x.foo);


Side note: methods like find() or filter(), and arrow functions are not supported by older browsers (like IE), so if you want to support these browsers, you should transpile your code using Babel (with the polyfill).

How can I horizontally center a <div> within another <div> using CSS?

","4,164,834",4446,1011,html css alignment centering ,https://stackoverflow.com/questions/114543/how-to-horizontally-center-a-div,112,"
You can apply this CSS to the inner <div>:
#inner {
  width: 50%;
  margin: 0 auto;
}

Of course, you don't have to set the width to 50%. Any width less than the containing <div> will work. The margin: 0 auto is what does the actual centering.
If you are targeting Internet Explorer 8 (and later), it might be better to have this instead:
#inner {
  display: table;
  margin: 0 auto;
}

It will make the inner element center horizontally and it works without setting a specific width.
Working example here:


#inner {
  display: table;
  margin: 0 auto;
  border: 1px solid black;
}

#outer {
  border: 1px solid red;
  width:100%
}
<div id=""outer"">
  <div id=""inner"">Foo foo</div>
</div>




EDIT
With flex-box, it is very easy to style the div horizontally and vertically centered.
#inner {  
  border: 1px solid black;
}

#outer {
  border: 1px solid red;
  width:100%
  display: flex;
  justify-content: center;
}

<div id=""outer"">
  <div id=""inner"">Foo foo</div>
</div>

To align the div vertically centered also, use property align-items: center.
",4898,"
If you don't want to set a fixed width on the inner div you could do something like this:


#outer {

}

#inner {
  display: inline-block;
}
<div id=""outer"">

I came across PECS (short for Producer extends and Consumer super) while reading up on generics. 
Can someone explain to me how to use PECS to resolve confusion between extends and super?
","110,698",757,564,java generics super bounded-wildcard pecs ,https://stackoverflow.com/questions/2723397/what-is-pecs-producer-extends-consumer-super,14,"
tl;dr: ""PECS"" is from the collection's point of view. If you are only pulling items from a generic collection, it is a producer and you should use extends; if you are only stuffing items in, it is a consumer and you should use super. If you do both with the same collection, you shouldn't use either extends or super.

Suppose you have a method that takes as its parameter a collection of things, but you want it to be more flexible than just accepting a Collection<Thing>.
Case 1: You want to go through the collection and do things with each item.
Then the list is a producer, so you should use a Collection<? extends Thing>.
The reasoning is that a Collection<? extends Thing> could hold any subtype of Thing, and thus each element will behave as a Thing when you perform your operation. (You actually cannot add anything to a Collection<? extends Thing>, because you cannot know at runtime which specific subtype of Thing the collection holds.)
Case 2: You want to add things to the collection.
Then the list is a consumer, so you should use a Collection<? super Thing>.
The reasoning here is that unlike Collection<? extends Thing>, Collection<? super Thing> can always hold a Thing no matter what the actual parameterized type is. Here you don't care what is already in the list as long as it will allow a Thing to be added; this is what ? super Thing guarantees.

Pretty much I need to write a program that checks if a list has any duplicates and if it does it removes them and returns a new list with the items that weren't duplicated/removed. This is what I have tried but honestly I don't know what to do.
def remove_duplicates():
    t = ['a', 'b', 'c', 'd']
    t2 = ['a', 'c', 'd']
    for t in t2:
        t.append(t.remove())
    return t

","1,598,307",1082,332,python algorithm list duplicates intersection ,https://stackoverflow.com/questions/7961363/removing-duplicates-in-the-lists,51,"
The common approach to get a unique collection of items is to use a set. Sets are unordered collections of distinct objects. To create a set from any iterable, you can simply pass it to the built-in set() function. If you later need a real list again, you can similarly pass the set to the list() function.
The following example should cover whatever you are trying to do:
>>> t = [1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 5, 6, 7, 8]
>>> t
[1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 5, 6, 7, 8]
>>> list(set(t))
[1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 7, 8]
>>> s = [1, 2, 3]
>>> list(set(t) - set(s))
[8, 5, 6, 7]

As you can see from the example result, the original order is not maintained. As mentioned above, sets themselves are unordered collections, so the order is lost. When converting a set back to a list, an arbitrary order is created.
Maintaining order
If order is important to you, then you will have to use a different mechanism. A very common solution for this is to rely on OrderedDict to keep the order of keys during insertion:
>>> from collections import OrderedDict
>>> list(OrderedDict.fromkeys(t))
[1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 7, 8]

Starting with Python 3.7, the built-in dictionary is guaranteed to maintain the insertion order as well, so you can also use that directly if you are on Python 3.7 or later (or CPython 3.6):
>>> list(dict.fromkeys(t))
[1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 7, 8]

Note that this may have some overhead of creating a dictionary first, and then creating a list from it. If you don’t actually need to preserve the order, you’re often better off using a set, especially because it gives you a lot more operations to work with. Check out this question for more details and alternative ways to preserve the order when removing duplicates.

Finally note that both the set as well as the OrderedDict/dict solutions require your items to be hashable. This usually means that they have to be immutable. If you have to deal with items that are not hashable (e.g. list objects), then you will have to use a slow approach in which you will basically have to compare every item with every other item in a nested loop.
",1736,"
In Python 2.7, the new way of removing duplicates from an iterable while keeping it in the original order is:
>>> from collections import OrderedDict
>>> list(OrderedDict.fromkeys('abracadabra'))
['a', 'b', 'r', 'c', 'd']

In Python 3.5, the OrderedDict has a C implementation. My timings show that this is now both the fastest and shortest of the various approaches for Python 3.5.
In Python 3.6, the regular dict became both ordered and compact.  (This feature is holds for CPython and PyPy but may not present in other implementations).  That gives us a new fastest way of deduping while retaining order:
>>> list(dict.fromkeys('abracadabra'))
['a', 'b', 'r', 'c', 'd']

In Python 3.7, the regular dict is guaranteed to both ordered across all implementations.  So, the shortest and fastest solution is:

As Greg Hewgill said, the typedef means you no longer have to write struct all over the place. That not only saves keystrokes, it also can make the code cleaner since it provides a smidgen more abstraction.
Stuff like
typedef struct {
  int x, y;
} Point;

Point point_new(int x, int y)
{
  Point a;
  a.x = x;
  a.y = y;
  return a;
}

becomes cleaner when you don't need to see the ""struct"" keyword all over the place, it looks more as if there really is a type called ""Point"" in your language. Which, after the typedef, is the case I guess.
Also note that while your example (and mine) omitted naming the struct  itself, actually naming it is also useful for when you want to provide an opaque type. Then you'd have code like this in the header, for instance:
typedef struct Point Point;

Point * point_new(int x, int y);

and then provide the struct definition in the implementation file:
struct Point
{
  int x, y;
};

Point * point_new(int x, int y)
{
  Point *p;
  if((p = malloc(sizeof *p)) != NULL)
  {
    p->x = x;
    p->y = y;
  }
  return p;
}

In this latter case, you cannot return the Point by value, since its definition is hidden from users of the header file. This is a technique used widely in GTK+, for instance.
UPDATE Note that there are also highly-regarded C projects where this use of typedef to hide struct is considered a bad idea, the Linux kernel is probably the most well-known such project. See Chapter 5 of The Linux Kernel CodingStyle document for Linus' angry words. :) My point is that the ""should"" in the question is perhaps not set in stone, after all.
",466,"
It's amazing how many people get this wrong. PLEASE don't typedef structs in C, it needlessly pollutes the global namespace which is typically very polluted already in large C programs.
Also, typedef'd structs without a tag name are a major cause of needless imposition of ordering relationships among header files.
Consider:
#ifndef FOO_H
#define FOO_H 1

#define FOO_DEF (0xDEADBABE)

struct bar; /* forward declaration, defined in bar.h*/

struct foo {
  struct bar *bar;
};

#endif

With such a definition, not using typedefs, it is possible for a compiland unit to include foo.h to get at the FOO_DEF definition.  If it doesn't attempt to dereference  the 'bar' member of the foo struct then there will be no need to include the ""bar.h"" file.
Also, since the namespaces are different between the tag names and the member names, it is possible to write very readable code such as:
struct foo *foo;

printf(""foo->bar = %p"", foo->bar);

Since the namespaces are separate, there is no conflict in naming variables coincident with their struct tag name.
If I have to maintain your code, I will remove your typedef'd structs.

I am learning how to use the threading and the multiprocessing modules in Python to run certain operations in parallel and speed up my code.

Also, it is not entirely clear to me how to instantiate a queue of jobs and having only 4 (for example) of them running in parallel, while the other wait for resources to free before being executed.
I find the examples in the documentation clear, but not very exhaustive; as soon as I try to complicate things a bit, I receive a lot of weird errors (like a method that can't be pickled, and so on).
So, when should I use the threading and multiprocessing modules?
Can you link me to some resources that explain the concepts behind these two modules and how to use them properly for complex tasks?
","64,034",145,117,python multithreading parallel-processing process multiprocessing ,https://stackoverflow.com/questions/18114285/what-are-the-differences-between-the-threading-and-multiprocessing-modules,6,"
What Giulio Franco says is true for multithreading vs. multiprocessing in general.
However, Python* has an added issue: There's a Global Interpreter Lock that prevents two threads in the same process from running Python code at the same time. This means that if you have 8 cores, and change your code to use 8 threads, it won't be able to use 800% CPU and run 8x faster; it'll use the same 100% CPU and run at the same speed. (In reality, it'll run a little slower, because there's extra overhead from threading, even if you don't have any shared data, but ignore that for now.)
There are exceptions to this. If your code's heavy computation doesn't actually happen in Python, but in some library with custom C code that does proper GIL handling, like a numpy app, you will get the expected performance benefit from threading. The same is true if the heavy computation is done by some subprocess that you run and wait on.
More importantly, there are cases where this doesn't matter. For example, a network server spends most of its time reading packets off the network, and a GUI app spends most of its time waiting for user events. One reason to use threads in a network server or GUI app is to allow you to do long-running ""background tasks"" without stopping the main thread from continuing to service network packets or GUI events. And that works just fine with Python threads. (In technical terms, this means Python threads give you concurrency, even though they don't give you core-parallelism.)
But if you're writing a CPU-bound program in pure Python, using more threads is generally not helpful.
Using separate processes has no such problems with the GIL, because each process has its own separate GIL. Of course you still have all the same tradeoffs between threads and processes as in any other languages—it's more difficult and more expensive to share data between processes than between threads, it can be costly to run a huge number of processes or to create and destroy them frequently, etc. But the GIL weighs heavily on the balance toward processes, in a way that isn't true for, say, C or Java. So, you will find yourself using multiprocessing a lot more often in Python than you would in C or Java.

Meanwhile, Python's ""batteries included"" philosophy brings some good news: It's very easy to write code that can be switched back and forth between threads and processes with a one-liner change.
If you design your code in terms of self-contained ""jobs"" that don't share anything with other jobs (or the main program) except input and output, you can use the concurrent.futures library to write your code around a thread pool like this:
with concurrent.futures.ThreadPoolExecutor(max_workers=4) as executor:
    executor.submit(job, argument)
    executor.map(some_function, collection_of_independent_things)
    # ...

You can even get the results of those jobs and pass them on to further jobs, wait for things in order of execution or in order of completion, etc.; read the section on Future objects for details.
Now, if it turns out that your program is constantly using 100% CPU, and adding more threads just makes it slower, then you're running into the GIL problem, so you need to switch to processes. All you have to do is change that first line:
with concurrent.futures.ProcessPoolExecutor(max_workers=4) as executor:

The only real caveat is that your jobs' arguments and return values have to be pickleable (and not take too much time or memory to pickle) to be usable cross-process. Usually this isn't a problem, but sometimes it is.

But what if your jobs can't be self-contained? If you can design your code in terms of jobs that pass messages from one to another, it's still pretty easy. You may have to use threading.Thread or multiprocessing.Process instead of relying on pools. And you will have to create queue.Queue or multiprocessing.Queue objects explicitly. (There are plenty of other options—pipes, sockets, files with flocks, … but the point is, you have to do something manually if the automatic magic of an Executor is insufficient.)
But what if you can't even rely on message passing? What if you need two jobs to both mutate the same structure, and see each others' changes? In that case, you will need to do manual synchronization (locks, semaphores, conditions, etc.) and, if you want to use processes, explicit shared-memory objects to boot. This is when multithreading (or multiprocessing) gets difficult. If you can avoid it, great; if you can't, you will need to read more than someone can put into an SO answer.

From a comment, you wanted to know what's different between threads and processes in Python. Really, if you read Giulio Franco's answer and mine and all of our links, that should cover everything… but a summary would definitely be useful, so here goes:

Threads share data by default; processes do not.
As a consequence of (1), sending data between processes generally requires pickling and unpickling it.**
As another consequence of (1), directly sharing data between processes generally requires putting it into low-level formats like Value, Array, and ctypes types.
Processes are not subject to the GIL.
On some platforms (mainly Windows), processes are much more expensive to create and destroy.
There are some extra restrictions on processes, some of which are different on different platforms. See Programming guidelines for details.
The threading module doesn't have some of the features of the multiprocessing module. (You can use multiprocessing.dummy to get most of the missing API on top of threads, or you can use higher-level modules like concurrent.futures and not worry about it.)


* It's not actually Python, the language, that has this issue, but CPython, the ""standard"" implementation of that language. Some other implementations don't have a GIL, like Jython.
** If you're using the fork start method for multiprocessing—which you can on most non-Windows platforms—each child process gets any resources the parent had when the child was started, which can be another way to pass data to children.
",267,"
Multiple threads can exist in a single process.
The threads that belong to the same process share the same memory area (can read from and write to the very same variables, and can interfere with one another).
On the contrary, different processes live in different memory areas, and each of them has its own variables. In order to communicate, processes have to use other channels (files, pipes or sockets).
If you want to parallelize a computation, you're probably going to need multithreading, because you probably want the threads to cooperate on the same memory.
Speaking about performance, threads are faster to create and manage than processes (because the OS doesn't need to allocate a whole new virtual memory area), and inter-thread communication is usually faster than inter-process communication. But threads are harder to program. Threads can interfere with one another, and can write to each other's memory, but the way this happens is not always obvious (due to several factors, mainly instruction reordering and memory caching), and so you are going to need synchronization primitives to control access to your variables.

59,600268,273192,How can I safely create a nested directory?,"
What is the most elegant way to check if the directory a file is going to be written to exists, and if not, create the directory using Python? Here is what I tried:

directory = os.path.dirname(file_path)

    os.stat(directory)
except:
    os.mkdir(directory)

Somehow, I missed os.path.exists (thanks kanja, Blair, and Douglas). This is what I have now:
def ensure_dir(file_path):
    directory = os.path.dirname(file_path)
    if not os.path.exists(directory):
        os.makedirs(directory)

Is there a flag for ""open"", that makes this happen automatically?

On Python ≥ 3.5, use pathlib.Path.mkdir:
from pathlib import Path
Path(""/my/directory"").mkdir(parents=True, exist_ok=True)

For older versions of Python, I see two answers with good qualities, each with a small flaw, so I will give my take on it:
Try os.path.exists, and consider os.makedirs for the creation.
import os
if not os.path.exists(directory):
    os.makedirs(directory)

As noted in comments and elsewhere, there's a race condition – if the directory is created between the os.path.exists and the os.makedirs calls, the os.makedirs will fail with an OSError. Unfortunately, blanket-catching OSError and continuing is not foolproof, as it will ignore a failure to create the directory due to other factors, such as insufficient permissions, full disk, etc.
One option would be to trap the OSError and examine the embedded error code (see Is there a cross-platform way of getting information from Python’s OSError):
import os, errno

try:
    os.makedirs(directory)
except OSError as e:
    if e.errno != errno.EEXIST:
        raise

Alternatively, there could be a second os.path.exists, but suppose another created the directory after the first check, then removed it before the second one – we could still be fooled. 
Depending on the application, the danger of concurrent operations may be more or less than the danger posed by other factors such as file permissions. The developer would have to know more about the particular application being developed and its expected environment before choosing an implementation.
Modern versions of Python improve this code quite a bit, both by exposing FileExistsError (in 3.3+)...
try:
    os.makedirs(""path/to/directory"")
except FileExistsError:
    # directory already exists
    pass

...and by allowing a keyword argument to os.makedirs called exist_ok (in 3.2+).
os.makedirs(""path/to/directory"", exist_ok=True)  # succeeds even if directory exists.

",5514,"
Python 3.5+:
import pathlib
pathlib.Path('/my/directory').mkdir(parents=True, exist_ok=True) 

pathlib.Path.mkdir as used above recursively creates the directory and does not raise an exception if the directory already exists. If you don't need or want the parents to be created, skip the parents argument.
Python 3.2+:
Using pathlib:
If you can, install the current pathlib backport named pathlib2. Do not install the older unmaintained backport named pathlib. Next, refer to the Python 3.5+ section above and use it the same.
If using Python 3.4, even though it comes with pathlib, it is missing the useful exist_ok option. The backport is intended to offer a newer and superior implementation of mkdir which includes this missing option.
Using os:
import os
os.makedirs(path, exist_ok=True)

os.makedirs as used above recursively creates the directory and does not raise an exception if the directory already exists. It has the optional exist_ok argument only if using Python 3.2+, with a default value of False. This argument does not exist in Python 2.x up to 2.7. As such, there is no need for manual exception handling as with Python 2.7.
Python 2.7+:
Using pathlib:
If you can, install the current pathlib backport named pathlib2. Do not install the older unmaintained backport named pathlib. Next, refer to the Python 3.5+ section above and use it the same.
Using os:
import os
try: 
    os.makedirs(path)
except OSError:
    if not os.path.isdir(path):
        raise

While a naive solution may first use os.path.isdir followed by os.makedirs, the solution above reverses the order of the two operations. In doing so, it prevents a common race condition having to do with a duplicated attempt at creating the directory, and also disambiguates files from directories.
Note that capturing the exception and using errno is of limited usefulness because OSError: [Errno 17] File exists, i.e. errno.EEXIST, is raised for both files and directories. It is more reliable simply to check if the directory exists.
Alternative:
mkpath creates the nested directory, and does nothing if the directory already exists. This works in both Python 2 and 3.
import distutils.dir_util
distutils.dir_util.mkpath(path)

Per Bug 10948, a severe limitation of this alternative is that it works only once per python process for a given path. In other words, if you use it to create a directory, then delete the directory from inside or outside Python, then use mkpath again to recreate the same directory, mkpath will simply silently use its invalid cached info of having previously created the directory, and will not actually make the directory again. In contrast, os.makedirs doesn't rely on any such cache. This limitation may be okay for some applications.

With regard to the directory's mode, please refer to the documentation if you care about it.

I notice that a pre-increment/decrement operator can be applied on a variable (like ++count). It compiles, but it does not actually change the value of the variable!
What is the behavior of the pre-increment/decrement operators (++/--) in Python? 
Why does Python deviate from the behavior of these operators seen in C/C++?
","1,052,374",842,149,python operators increment decrement ,https://stackoverflow.com/questions/1485841/behaviour-of-increment-and-decrement-operators-in-python,9,"
++ is not an operator. It is two + operators. The + operator is the identity operator, which does nothing. (Clarification: the + and - unary operators only work on numbers, but I presume that you wouldn't expect a hypothetical ++ operator to work on strings.)
++count

Parses as
+(+count)

Which translates to
count

You have to use the slightly longer += operator to do what you want to do:
count += 1

I suspect the ++ and -- operators were left out for consistency and simplicity. I don't know the exact argument Guido van Rossum gave for the decision, but I can imagine a few arguments:

Simpler parsing. Technically, parsing ++count is ambiguous, as it could be +, +, count (two unary + operators) just as easily as it could be ++, count (one unary ++ operator). It's not a significant syntactic ambiguity, but it does exist.
Simpler language. ++ is nothing more than a synonym for += 1. It was a shorthand invented because C compilers were stupid and didn't know how to optimize a += 1 into the inc instruction most computers have. In this day of optimizing compilers and bytecode interpreted languages, adding operators to a language to allow programmers to optimize their code is usually frowned upon, especially in a language like Python that is designed to be consistent and readable.
Confusing side-effects. One common newbie error in languages with ++ operators is mixing up the differences (both in precedence and in return value) between the pre- and post-increment/decrement operators, and Python likes to eliminate language ""gotcha""-s. The precedence issues of pre-/post-increment in C are pretty hairy, and incredibly easy to mess up.

",1102,"
When you want to increment or decrement, you typically want to do that on an integer. Like so:
b++

But in Python, integers are immutable. That is you can't change them. This is because the integer objects can be used under several names. Try this:
>>> b = 5
>>> a = 5
>>> id(a)
162334512
>>> id(b)
162334512
>>> a is b
True

a and b above are actually the same object. If you incremented a, you would also increment b. That's not what you want. So you have to reassign. Like this:
b = b + 1

Or simpler:
b += 1

Which will reassign b to b+1. That is not an increment operator, because it does not increment b, it reassigns it.
In short: Python behaves differently here, because it is not C, and is not a low level wrapper around machine code, but a high-level dynamic language, where increments don't make sense, and also are not as necessary as in C, where you use them every time you have a loop, for example.

If you want to find all commits where commit message contains given word, use
$ git log --grep=word

If you want to find all commits where ""word"" was added or removed in the file contents (to be more exact: where number of occurences of ""word"" changed), i.e. search the commit contents, use so called 'pickaxe' search with
$ git log -Sword

In modern git there is also
$ git log -Gword

to look for differences whose added or removed line matches ""word"" (also commit contents).
Note that -G by default accepts a regex, while -S accepts a string, but can be modified to accept regexes using the --pickaxe-regex.

To illustrate the difference between -S<regex> --pickaxe-regex and -G<regex>, consider a commit with the following diff in the same file:
+    return !regexec(regexp, two->ptr, 1, &regmatch, 0);
...
-    hit = !regexec(regexp, mf2.ptr, 1, &regmatch, 0);

While git log -G""regexec\(regexp"" will show this commit, git log -S""regexec\(regexp"" --pickaxe-regex will not (because the number of occurrences of that string did not change).


With Git 2.25.1 (Feb. 2020), the documentation is clarified around those regexes.

This assigns to delete_after the value of delete_after if it is not a falsey value otherwise it assigns the string ""my default here"". For more detail, check out Doug Crockford's survey of the language and check out the section on Operators.
This approach does not work if you want to pass in a falsey value i.e. false, null, undefined, 0 or """". If you require falsey values to be passed in you would need to use the method in Tom Ritter's answer.

In Firefox 3 and Safari 3, you can use RGBA like Georg Schölly mentioned.
A little known trick is that you can use it in Internet Explorer as well using the gradient filter.
background-color: rgba(0, 255, 0, 0.5);
filter: progid:DXImageTransform.Microsoft.Gradient(GradientType=0, StartColorStr='#7F00FF00', EndColorStr='#7F00FF00');

The first hex number defines the alpha value of the color.
Full solution all browsers:
.alpha60 {
    /* Fallback for web browsers that doesn't support RGBa */
    background: rgb(0, 0, 0) transparent;
    /* RGBa with 0.6 opacity */
    background: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.6);
    /* For IE 5.5 - 7*/
    filter:progid:DXImageTransform.Microsoft.gradient(startColorstr=#99000000, endColorstr=#99000000);
    /* For IE 8*/
    -ms-filter: ""progid:DXImageTransform.Microsoft.gradient(startColorstr=#99000000, endColorstr=#99000000)"";
}

This is from CSS background transparency without affecting child elements, through RGBa and filters.

I read in the official doc of the Google CDN that this is the src to jQuery: 
<script src=""//ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.8.1/jquery.min.js""></script>

However, it is annoying to have to change my jQuery src reference at each version update. 
I've found that if I set the version to 1 then Google returns the latest version of jQuery.
http://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1/jquery.min.js
/*! jQuery v1.8.2 jquery.com | jquery.org/license */

Is this the right thing to do? Is there any official URL to reference the latest version of jQuery hosted on the Google CDN?
","214,377",103,35,jquery google-cdn ,https://stackoverflow.com/questions/12608242/latest-jquery-version-on-googles-cdn,5,"
UPDATE 7/3/2014: As of now, jquery-latest.js is no longer being updated.
From the jQuery blog:

We know that http://code.jquery.com/jquery-latest.js is abused 
  because of the CDN statistics
  showing it’s the most popular file. That wouldn’t be the case if it
  was only being used by developers to make a local copy.
We have decided to stop
  updating this file, as well as the minified copy, keeping both files
  at version 1.11.1 forever.
The Google CDN team has joined us in this effort to prevent
  inadvertent web breakage and no longer updates the file at
  http://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1/jquery.js. That file
  will stay locked at version 1.11.1 as well.

The following, now moot, answer is preserved here for historical reasons.

Don't do this. Seriously, don't.
Linking to major versions of jQuery does work, but it's a bad idea -- whole new features get added and deprecated with each decimal update. If you update jQuery automatically without testing your code COMPLETELY, you risk an unexpected surprise if the API for some critical method has changed.
Here's what you should be doing: write your code using the latest version of jQuery. Test it, debug it, publish it when it's ready for production. 
Then, when a new version of jQuery rolls out, ask yourself: Do I need this new version in my code? For instance, is there some critical browser compatibility that didn't exist before, or will it speed up my code in most browsers? 
If the answer is ""no"", don't bother updating your code to the latest jQuery version. Doing so might even add NEW errors to your code which didn't exist before. No responsible developer would automatically include new code from another site without testing it thoroughly.
There's simply no good reason to ALWAYS be using the latest version of jQuery. The old versions are still available on the CDNs, and if they work for your purposes, then why bother replacing them?

A secondary, but possibly more important, issue is caching. Many people link to jQuery on a CDN because many other sites do, and your users have a good chance of having that version already cached.
The problem is, caching only works if you provide a full version number. If you provide a partial version number, far-future caching doesn't happen -- because if it did, some users would get different minor versions of jQuery from the same URL. (Say that the link to 1.7 points to 1.7.1 one day and 1.7.2 the next day. How will the browser make sure it's getting the latest version today? Answer: no caching.)

In fact here's a breakdown of several options and their expiration
  settings...
http://code.jquery.com/jquery-latest.min.js  (no cache)
http://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1/jquery.min.js  (1 hour)
http://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.7/jquery.min.js  (1
  hour)
http://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.7.1/jquery.min.js  (1
  year)

So, by linking to jQuery this way, you're actually eliminating one of the major reasons to use a CDN in the first place.

http://code.jquery.com/jquery-latest.min.js may not always give you the version you expect, either. As of this writing, it links to the latest version of jQuery 1.x, even though jQuery 2.x has been released as well. This is because jQuery 1.x is compatible with older browsers including IE 6/7/8, and jQuery 2.x is not. If you want the latest version of jQuery 2.x, then (for now) you need to specify that explicitly.
The two versions have the same API, so there is no perceptual difference for compatible browsers. However, jQuery 1.x is a larger download than 2.x.
",182,"
I don't know if/where it's published, but you can get the latest release by omitting the minor and build numbers.
Latest 1.8.x:
<script src=""//ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.8/jquery.min.js""></script>

Latest 1.x:
<script src=""//ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1/jquery.min.js""></script>

However, do keep in mind that these links have a much shorter cache timeout than with the full version number, so your users may be downloading them more than you'd like. See The crucial .0 in Google CDN references to jQuery 1.x.0 for more information.

67,143847,237104,How do I check if an array includes a value in JavaScript?,"
What is the most concise and efficient way to find out if a JavaScript array contains a value?
This is the only way I know to do it:
function contains(a, obj) {
    for (var i = 0; i < a.length; i++) {
        if (a[i] === obj) {
            return true;
        }
    }
    return false;
}

Is there a better and more concise way to accomplish this?
This is very closely related to Stack Overflow question Best way to find an item in a JavaScript Array? which addresses finding objects in an array using indexOf.
","2,693,482",4140,669,javascript arrays algorithm time-complexity javascript-objects ,https://stackoverflow.com/questions/237104/how-do-i-check-if-an-array-includes-a-value-in-javascript,54,"
Modern browsers have Array#includes, which does exactly that and is widely supported by everyone except IE:


console.log(['joe', 'jane', 'mary'].includes('jane')); //true



For internet explorer you can use below function to check an array include a value:


function includes(container, value) {
    var returnValue = false;
    var pos = container.indexOf(value);
    if (pos >= 0) {
        returnValue = true;
    }
    return returnValue;
}
//examples---------
console.log(includes([1,2,3],2))
console.log(includes([1,2,3],'a'))
console.log(includes(""abc"",'a'))
console.log(includes(""abc"",'e'))



You can also use Array#indexOf, which is less direct, but doesn't require polyfills for outdated browsers.

Many frameworks also offer similar methods:

jQuery: $.inArray(value, array, [fromIndex])
Underscore.js: _.contains(array, value) (also aliased as _.include and _.includes)
Dojo Toolkit: dojo.indexOf(array, value, [fromIndex, findLast])
Prototype: array.indexOf(value)
MooTools: array.indexOf(value)
MochiKit: findValue(array, value)
MS Ajax: array.indexOf(value)
Ext: Ext.Array.contains(array, value)
Lodash: _.includes(array, value, [from]) (is _.contains prior 4.0.0)
Ramda: R.includes(value, array)

Notice that some frameworks implement this as a function, while others add the function to the array prototype.
",4567,"
Update from 2019: This answer is from 2008 (11 years old!) and is not relevant for modern JS usage. The promised performance improvement was based on a benchmark done in browsers of that time. It might not be relevant to modern JS execution contexts. If you need an easy solution, look for other answers. If you need the best performance, benchmark for yourself in the relevant execution environments.
As others have said, the iteration through the array is probably the best way, but it has been proven that a decreasing while loop is the fastest way to iterate in JavaScript. So you may want to rewrite your code as follows:
function contains(a, obj) {
    var i = a.length;
    while (i--) {
       if (a[i] === obj) {
           return true;
       }
    }
    return false;
}

Of course, you may as well extend Array prototype:
Array.prototype.contains = function(obj) {
    var i = this.length;
    while (i--) {
        if (this[i] === obj) {
            return true;
        }
    }
    return false;
}

And now you can simply use the following:
alert([1, 2, 3].contains(2)); // => true
alert([1, 2, 3].contains('2')); // => false

Try this:

that could be changed to a short code version ...
Intent intent = new Intent(Intent.ACTION_VIEW).setData(Uri.parse(""http://www.stackoverflow.com""));      
startActivity(intent); 

or :
Intent intent = new Intent(Intent.ACTION_VIEW, Uri.parse(""http://www.stackoverflow.com""));

Bash executes the redirects from left to right as follows:

>>file.txt: Open file.txt in append mode and redirect stdout there.
2>&1: Redirect stderr to ""where stdout is currently going"". In this case, that is a file opened in append mode. In other words, the &1 reuses the file descriptor which stdout currently uses.

There are two ways to do this, depending on your Bash version.
The classic and portable (Bash pre-4) way is:
cmd >> outfile 2>&1

A nonportable way, starting with Bash 4 is
cmd &>> outfile

(analog to &> outfile)
For good coding style, you should

decide if portability is a concern (then use classic way)
decide if portability even to Bash pre-4 is a concern (then use classic way)
no matter which syntax you use, not change it within the same script (confusion!)

If your script already starts with #!/bin/sh (no matter if intended or not), then the Bash 4 solution, and in general any Bash-specific code, is not the way to go.
Also remember that Bash 4 &>> is just shorter syntax — it does not introduce any new functionality or anything like that.

This depends a lot on what you mean by ""revert"".
Temporarily switch to a different commit
If you want to temporarily go back to it, fool around, then come back to where you are, all you have to do is check out the desired commit:
# This will detach your HEAD, that is, leave you with no branch checked out:
git checkout 0d1d7fc32

Or if you want to make commits while you're there, go ahead and make a new branch while you're at it:
git checkout -b old-state 0d1d7fc32

To go back to where you were, just check out the branch you were on again. (If you've made changes, as always when switching branches, you'll have to deal with them as appropriate. You could reset to throw them away; you could stash, checkout, stash pop to take them with you; you could commit them to a branch there if you want a branch there.)
Hard delete unpublished commits
If, on the other hand, you want to really get rid of everything you've done since then, there are two possibilities. One, if you haven't published any of these commits, simply reset:
# This will destroy any local modifications.
# Don't do it if you have uncommitted work you want to keep.
git reset --hard 0d1d7fc32

# Alternatively, if there's work to keep:
git stash
git reset --hard 0d1d7fc32
git stash pop
# This saves the modifications, then reapplies that patch after resetting.
# You could get merge conflicts, if you've modified things which were
# changed since the commit you reset to.

If you mess up, you've already thrown away your local changes, but you can at least get back to where you were before by resetting again.
Undo published commits with new commits
On the other hand, if you've published the work, you probably don't want to reset the branch, since that's effectively rewriting history. In that case, you could indeed revert the commits. With Git, revert has a very specific meaning: create a commit with the reverse patch to cancel it out. This way you don't rewrite any history.
# This will create three separate revert commits:
git revert a867b4af 25eee4ca 0766c053

# It also takes ranges. This will revert the last two commits:
git revert HEAD~2..HEAD

#Similarly, you can revert a range of commits using commit hashes (non inclusive of first hash):
git revert 0d1d7fc..a867b4a

# Reverting a merge commit
git revert -m 1 <merge_commit_sha>

# To get just one, you could use `rebase -i` to squash them afterwards
# Or, you could do it manually (be sure to do this at top level of the repo)
# get your index and work tree into the desired state, without changing HEAD:
git checkout 0d1d7fc32 .

# Then commit. Be sure and write a good message describing what you just did
git commit

The git-revert manpage actually covers a lot of this in its description. Another useful link is this git-scm.com section discussing git-revert.
If you decide you didn't want to revert after all, you can revert the revert (as described here) or reset back to before the revert (see the previous section).

This will revert everything from the HEAD back to the commit hash, meaning it will recreate that commit state in the working tree as if every commit after 0766c053 had been walked back. You can then commit the current tree, and it will create a brand new commit essentially equivalent to the commit you ""reverted"" to.  
(The --no-commit flag lets git revert all the commits at once- otherwise you'll be prompted for a message for each commit in the range, littering your history with unnecessary new commits.)
This is a safe and easy way to rollback to a previous state. No history is destroyed, so it can be used for commits that have already been made public.

How do I get the path of the directory in which a Bash script is located, inside that script?
I want to use a Bash script as a launcher for another application. I want to change the working directory to the one where the Bash script is located, so I can operate on the files in that directory, like so: 
$ ./application

","1,817,415",5142,1807,bash directory ,https://stackoverflow.com/questions/59895/how-to-get-the-source-directory-of-a-bash-script-from-within-the-script-itself,67,"
#!/bin/bash

DIR=""$( cd ""$( dirname ""${BASH_SOURCE[0]}"" )"" >/dev/null 2>&1 && pwd )""

is a useful one-liner which will give you the full directory name of the script no matter where it is being called from.
It will work as long as the last component of the path used to find the script is not a symlink (directory links are OK).  If you also want to resolve any links to the script itself, you need a multi-line solution:
#!/bin/bash

SOURCE=""${BASH_SOURCE[0]}""
while [ -h ""$SOURCE"" ]; do # resolve $SOURCE until the file is no longer a symlink
  DIR=""$( cd -P ""$( dirname ""$SOURCE"" )"" >/dev/null 2>&1 && pwd )""
  SOURCE=""$(readlink ""$SOURCE"")""
  [[ $SOURCE != /* ]] && SOURCE=""$DIR/$SOURCE"" # if $SOURCE was a relative symlink, we need to resolve it relative to the path where the symlink file was located
done
DIR=""$( cd -P ""$( dirname ""$SOURCE"" )"" >/dev/null 2>&1 && pwd )""

This last one will work with any combination of aliases, source, bash -c, symlinks, etc.
Beware: if you cd to a different directory before running this snippet, the result may be incorrect!
Also, watch out for $CDPATH gotchas, and stderr output side effects if the user has smartly overridden cd to redirect output to stderr instead (including escape sequences, such as when calling update_terminal_cwd >&2 on Mac). Adding >/dev/null 2>&1 at the end of your cd command will take care of both possibilities.
To understand how it works, try running this more verbose form:
#!/bin/bash

SOURCE=""${BASH_SOURCE[0]}""
while [ -h ""$SOURCE"" ]; do # resolve $SOURCE until the file is no longer a symlink
  TARGET=""$(readlink ""$SOURCE"")""
  if [[ $TARGET == /* ]]; then
    echo ""SOURCE '$SOURCE' is an absolute symlink to '$TARGET'""
    SOURCE=""$TARGET""
  else
    DIR=""$( dirname ""$SOURCE"" )""
    echo ""SOURCE '$SOURCE' is a relative symlink to '$TARGET' (relative to '$DIR')""
    SOURCE=""$DIR/$TARGET"" # if $SOURCE was a relative symlink, we need to resolve it relative to the path where the symlink file was located
  fi
done
echo ""SOURCE is '$SOURCE'""
RDIR=""$( dirname ""$SOURCE"" )""
DIR=""$( cd -P ""$( dirname ""$SOURCE"" )"" >/dev/null 2>&1 && pwd )""
if [ ""$DIR"" != ""$RDIR"" ]; then
  echo ""DIR '$RDIR' resolves to '$DIR'""
fi
echo ""DIR is '$DIR'""

And it will print something like:
SOURCE './scriptdir.sh' is a relative symlink to 'sym2/scriptdir.sh' (relative to '.')
SOURCE is './sym2/scriptdir.sh'
DIR './sym2' resolves to '/home/ubuntu/dotfiles/fo fo/real/real1/real2'
DIR is '/home/ubuntu/dotfiles/fo fo/real/real1/real2'

",6822,"
Use dirname ""$0"":
#!/bin/bash
echo ""The script you are running has basename `basename ""$0""`, dirname `dirname ""$0""`""
echo ""The present working directory is `pwd`""

using pwd alone will not work if you are not running the script from the directory it is contained in.
[matt@server1 ~]$ pwd
/home/matt
[matt@server1 ~]$ ./test2.sh
The script you are running has basename test2.sh, dirname .

How can I horizontally center a <div> within another <div> using CSS?
<div id=""outer"">
  <div id=""inner"">Foo foo</div>
</div>

","4,164,837",4446,1011,html css alignment centering ,https://stackoverflow.com/questions/114543/how-to-horizontally-center-a-div,112,"
You can apply this CSS to the inner <div>:
#inner {
  width: 50%;
  margin: 0 auto;
}

Of course, you don't have to set the width to 50%. Any width less than the containing <div> will work. The margin: 0 auto is what does the actual centering.
If you are targeting Internet Explorer 8 (and later), it might be better to have this instead:
#inner {
  display: table;
  margin: 0 auto;
}

It will make the inner element center horizontally and it works without setting a specific width.
Working example here:


#inner {
  display: table;
  margin: 0 auto;
  border: 1px solid black;
}

#outer {
  border: 1px solid red;
  width:100%
}
<div id=""outer"">
  <div id=""inner"">Foo foo</div>
</div>




EDIT
With flex-box, it is very easy to style the div horizontally and vertically centered.
#inner {  
  border: 1px solid black;
}

#outer {
  border: 1px solid red;
  width:100%
  display: flex;
  justify-content: center;
}

<div id=""outer"">
  <div id=""inner"">Foo foo</div>
</div>

To align the div vertically centered also, use property align-items: center.
",4898,"
If you don't want to set a fixed width on the inner div you could do something like this:


#outer {
  width: 100%;
  text-align: center;
}

#inner {
  display: inline-block;
}
<div id=""outer"">  
    <div id=""inner"">Foo foo</div>
</div>



That makes the inner div into an inline element that can be centered with text-align.

Just construct a new Date object without any arguments; this will assign the current date and time to the new object.

Date d = new Date();

In the words of the Javadocs for the zero-argument constructor:

Allocates a Date object and initializes it so that it represents the time at which it was allocated, measured to the nearest millisecond.

Make sure you're using java.util.Date and not java.sql.Date -- the latter doesn't have a zero-arg constructor, and has somewhat different semantics that are the topic of an entirely different conversation. :)

The Java Date and Calendar classes are considered by many to be poorly designed.  You should take a look at Joda Time, a library commonly used in lieu of Java's built-in date libraries.

I've always thought of the if not x is None version to be more clear, but Google's style guide and PEP-8 both use if x is not None. Is there any minor performance difference (I'm assuming not), and is there any case where one really doesn't fit (making the other a clear winner for my convention)?*

",1038,"
Both Google and Python's style guide is the best practice:
if x is not None:
    # Do something about x

Using not x can cause unwanted results. 
See below:
>>> x = 1
>>> not x
False
>>> x = [1]
>>> not x
False
>>> x = 0
>>> not x
True
>>> x = [0]         # You don't want to fall in this one.
>>> not x
False

Truth Value Testing


Edit for comment below: 
I just did some more testing. not x is None doesn't negate x first and then compared to None. In fact, it seems the is operator has a higher precedence when used that way:
>>> x
[0]
>>> not x is None
True
>>> not (x is None)
True
>>> (not x) is None
False

Therefore, not x is None is just, in my honest opinion, best avoided.

More edit:
I just did more testing and can confirm that bukzor's comment is correct. (At least, I wasn't able to prove it otherwise.)
This means if x is not None has the exact result as if not x is None. I stand corrected. Thanks bukzor.
However, my answer still stands: Use the conventional if x is not None. :]

I am trying to write a batch script and trying to wait 10 seconds between 2 function calls. The command: 
sleep 10

Does not make the batch file wait for 10 seconds.
I am running Windows XP.
Note: This is not a complete duplicate of Sleeping in a batch file as the other question is about also about python, while this is about windows batch files.
","671,683",165,31,batch-file ,https://stackoverflow.com/questions/735285/how-to-wait-in-a-batch-script,6,"
You can ping an address that doesn't exist and specify the desired timeout:
ping 192.0.2.2 -n 1 -w 10000 > nul

And since the address does not exist, it'll wait 10,000 ms (10 seconds) and return.

The -w 10000 part specifies the desired timeout in milliseconds.
The -n 1 part tells ping that it should only try once (normally it'd try 4 times).
The > nul part is appended so the ping command doesn't output anything to screen.

You can easily make a sleep command yourself by creating a sleep.bat somewhere in your PATH and using the above technique:
rem SLEEP.BAT - sleeps by the supplied number of seconds

@ping 192.0.2.2 -n 1 -w %1000 > nul


NOTE (September 2002): The 192.0.2.x address is reserved as per RFC 3330 so it definitely will not exist in the real world. Quoting from the spec:

192.0.2.0/24 - This block is assigned as ""TEST-NET"" for use in
documentation and example code.  It is often used in conjunction with
domain names example.com or example.net in vendor and protocol
documentation.  Addresses within this block should not appear on the
public Internet.

",268,"
You'd better ping 127.0.0.1. Windows ping pauses for one second between pings so you if you want to sleep for 10 seconds, use
ping -n 11 127.0.0.1 > nul

This way you don't need to worry about unexpected early returns (say, there's no default route and the 123.45.67.89 is instantly known to be unreachable.)

I'd like to accomplish this without having the text and the background as two separate elements.
When trying:

  filter: alpha(opacity=100);

Either use a semi-transparent PNG image or use CSS 3:
background-color: rgba(255, 0, 0, 0.5);

Here's an article from css3.info, Opacity, RGBA and compromise (2007-06-03).



<p style=""background-color: rgba(255, 0, 0, 0.5);"">
  <span>Hello, World!</span>
</p>



",2302,"
In Firefox 3 and Safari 3, you can use RGBA like Georg Schölly mentioned.
A little known trick is that you can use it in Internet Explorer as well using the gradient filter.
background-color: rgba(0, 255, 0, 0.5);
filter: progid:DXImageTransform.Microsoft.Gradient(GradientType=0, StartColorStr='#7F00FF00', EndColorStr='#7F00FF00');

The first hex number defines the alpha value of the color.
Full solution all browsers:
.alpha60 {
    /* Fallback for web browsers that doesn't support RGBa */
    background: rgb(0, 0, 0) transparent;
    /* RGBa with 0.6 opacity */
    background: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.6);
    /* For IE 5.5 - 7*/
    filter:progid:DXImageTransform.Microsoft.gradient(startColorstr=#99000000, endColorstr=#99000000);
    /* For IE 8*/
    -ms-filter: ""progid:DXImageTransform.Microsoft.gradient(startColorstr=#99000000, endColorstr=#99000000)"";
}

This is from CSS background transparency without affecting child elements, through RGBa and filters.

git-clean - Remove untracked files from the working tree
Synopsis
git clean [-d] [-f] [-i] [-n] [-q] [-e <pattern>] [-x | -X] [--] <path>…​

Description
Cleans the working tree by recursively removing files that are not under version control, starting from the current directory.
Normally, only files unknown to Git are removed, but if the -x option is specified, ignored files are also removed. This can, for example, be useful to remove all build products.
If any optional <path>... arguments are given, only those paths are affected.


Step 1 is to show what will be deleted by using the -n option:
# Print out the list of files which will be removed (dry run)
git clean -n

Clean Step - beware: this will delete files:
# Delete the files from the repository
git clean -f


To remove directories, run git clean -f -d or git clean -fd
To remove ignored files, run git clean -f -X or git clean -fX
To remove ignored and non-ignored files, run git clean -f -x or git clean -fx

Note the case difference on the X for the two latter commands.
If clean.requireForce is set to ""true"" (the default) in your configuration, one needs to specify -f otherwise nothing will actually happen.
Again see the git-clean docs for more information.


Options
-f, --force 
If the Git configuration variable clean.requireForce is not set to
  false, git clean will refuse to run unless given -f, -n or -i.
-x
Don’t use the standard ignore rules read from .gitignore (per
  directory) and $GIT_DIR/info/exclude, but do still use the ignore
  rules given with -e options. This allows removing all untracked files,
  including build products. This can be used (possibly in conjunction
  with git reset) to create a pristine working directory to test a clean
  build.
-X
Remove only files ignored by Git. This may be useful to rebuild
  everything from scratch, but keep manually created files.
-n, --dry-run
Don’t actually remove anything, just show what would be done.
-d
Remove untracked directories in addition to untracked files. If an
  untracked directory is managed by a different Git repository, it is
  not removed by default. Use -f option twice if you really want to
  remove such a directory.

Use git clean -f -d to make sure that directories are also removed.

Don’t actually remove anything, just show what would be done.

Vertical Centering in CSS
http://www.jakpsatweb.cz/css/css-vertical-center-solution.html
Article summary:
For a CSS 2 browser, one can use display:table/display:table-cell to center content.
A sample is also available at JSFiddle:


div { border:1px solid green;}
<div style=""display: table; height: 400px; overflow: hidden;"">
  <div style=""display: table-cell; vertical-align: middle;"">
    <div>
      everything is vertically centered in modern IE8+ and others.
    </div>
  </div>
</div>



It is possible to merge hacks for old browsers (Internet Explorer 6/7) into styles with using # to hide styles from newer browsers:


div { border:1px solid green;}
<div style=""display: table; height: 400px; #position: relative; overflow: hidden;"">
  <div style=
    ""#position: absolute; #top: 50%;display: table-cell; vertical-align: middle;"">
    <div style="" #position: relative; #top: -50%"">
      everything is vertically centered
    </div>
  </div>
</div>



",807,"
You need to add the line-height attribute and that attribute must match the height of the div. In your case:


.center {
  height: 309px;
  line-height: 309px; /* same as height! */
}
<div class=""center"">
  A single line.
</div>



In fact, you could probably remove the height attribute altogether.
This only works for one line of text though, so be careful.

I have a byte[] array that is loaded from a file that I happen to known contains UTF-8.   
In some debugging code, I need to convert it to a string. Is there a one liner that will do this? 
Under the covers it should be just an allocation and a memcopy, so even if it is not implemented, it should be possible.
","1,142,272",963,155,c# .net arrays string type-conversion ,https://stackoverflow.com/questions/1003275/how-to-convert-utf-8-byte-to-string,15,"
string result = System.Text.Encoding.UTF8.GetString(byteArray);

",1514,"
There're at least four different ways doing this conversion.

Encoding's GetString, but you won't be able to get the original bytes back if those bytes have non-ASCII characters.
BitConverter.ToString The output is a ""-"" delimited string, but there's no .NET built-in method to convert the string back to byte array.
Convert.ToBase64String You can easily convert the output string back to byte array by using Convert.FromBase64String. Note: The output string could contain '+', '/' and '='. If you want to use the string in a URL, you need to explicitly encode it.
HttpServerUtility.UrlTokenEncodeYou can easily convert the output string back to byte array by using HttpServerUtility.UrlTokenDecode. The output string is already URL friendly! The downside is it needs System.Web assembly if your project is not a web project.

A full example:
byte[] bytes = { 130, 200, 234, 23 }; // A byte array contains non-ASCII (or non-readable) characters

string s1 = Encoding.UTF8.GetString(bytes); // ���
byte[] decBytes1 = Encoding.UTF8.GetBytes(s1);  // decBytes1.Length == 10 !!
// decBytes1 not same as bytes
// Using UTF-8 or other Encoding object will get similar results

string s2 = BitConverter.ToString(bytes);   // 82-C8-EA-17
String[] tempAry = s2.Split('-');
byte[] decBytes2 = new byte[tempAry.Length];
for (int i = 0; i < tempAry.Length; i++)
    decBytes2[i] = Convert.ToByte(tempAry[i], 16);
// decBytes2 same as bytes

string s3 = Convert.ToBase64String(bytes);  // gsjqFw==
byte[] decByte3 = Convert.FromBase64String(s3);
// decByte3 same as bytes

string s4 = HttpServerUtility.UrlTokenEncode(bytes);    // gsjqFw2
byte[] decBytes4 = HttpServerUtility.UrlTokenDecode(s4);
// decBytes4 same as bytes

I have this string:

Doing:

seems to only remove the first occurrence of abc in the string above.
How can I replace all occurrences of it?
","3,577,843",4594,768,javascript string replace ,https://stackoverflow.com/questions/1144783/how-to-replace-all-occurrences-of-a-string,70,"
Update: As of August 2020, you can use replaceAll
as shown here:
let result = ""1 abc 2 abc 3"".replaceAll(""abc"", ""xyz"");
// `result` is ""1 xyz 2 xyz 3""


For older browsers:
Note: Don't use the following solution in performance critical code.
As an alternative to regular expressions for a simple literal string, you could use
str = ""Test abc test test abc test..."".split(""abc"").join("""");

The general pattern is
str.split(search).join(replacement)

This used to be faster in some cases than using replaceAll and a regular expression, but that doesn't seem to be the case anymore in modern browsers.
Benchmark: https://jsperf.com/replace-all-vs-split-join
Conclusion: If you have a performance critical use case (e.g processing hundreds of strings), use the Regexp method. But for most typical use cases, this is well worth not having to worry about special characters.
",1843,"
As of August 2020, greenfield browsers have support for the String.replaceAll() method defined by the ECMAScript 2021 language specification. For older/legacy browser support, the below still applies.

str = str.replace(/abc/g, '');

In response to comment:
var find = 'abc';
var re = new RegExp(find, 'g');

str = str.replace(re, '');

In response to Click Upvote's comment, you could simplify it even more:
function replaceAll(str, find, replace) {
  return str.replace(new RegExp(find, 'g'), replace);
}

Note: Regular expressions contain special (meta) characters, and as such it is dangerous to blindly pass an argument in the find function above without pre-processing it to escape those characters.  This is covered in the Mozilla Developer Network's JavaScript Guide on Regular Expressions, where they present the following utility function (which has changed at least twice since this answer was originally written, so make sure to check the MDN site for potential updates):
function escapeRegExp(string) {
  return string.replace(/[.*+\-?^${}()|[\]\\]/g, '\\$&'); // $& means the whole matched string
}

So in order to make the replaceAll() function above safer, it could be modified to the following if you also include escapeRegExp:
function replaceAll(str, find, replace) {
  return str.replace(new RegExp(escapeRegExp(find), 'g'), replace);
}

or

Stashing, temporary commits and rebasing may all be overkill. If you haven't added the changed files to the index, yet, then you may be able to just checkout the other branch.
git checkout branch2

This will work so long as no files that you are editing are different between branch1 and branch2. It will leave you on branch2 with you working changes preserved. If they are different then you can specify that you want to merge your local changes with the changes introduced by switching branches with the -m option to checkout.
git checkout -m branch2

If you've added changes to the index then you'll want to undo these changes with a reset first. (This will preserve your working copy, it will just remove the staged changes.)

I have a JavaScript object like the following:
var p = {

    ""p2"": ""value2"",
    ""p3"": ""value3""
};

Now I want to loop through all p elements (p1, p2, p3...) And get their keys and values. How can I do that?
I can modify the JavaScript object if necessary. My ultimate goal is to loop through some key value pairs and if possible I want to avoid using eval.
","2,057,930",3008,727,javascript loops for-loop each ,https://stackoverflow.com/questions/684672/how-do-i-loop-through-or-enumerate-a-javascript-object,41,"
You can use the for-in loop as shown by others. However, you also have to make sure that the key you get is an actual property of an object, and doesn't come from the prototype.
Here is the snippet:


var p = {
    ""p1"": ""value1"",
    ""p2"": ""value2"",
    ""p3"": ""value3""
};

for (var key in p) {
    if (p.hasOwnProperty(key)) {
        console.log(key + "" -> "" + p[key]);
    }
}



For-of with Object.keys() alternative:


var p = {
    0: ""value1"",
    ""b"": ""value2"",
    key: ""value3""
};

for (var key of Object.keys(p)) {
    console.log(key + "" -> "" + p[key])
}



Notice the use of for-of instead of for-in, if not used it will return undefined on named properties, and Object.keys() ensures the use of only the object's own properties without the whole prototype-chain properties
Using the new Object.entries() method:
Note: This method is not supported natively by Internet Explorer. You may consider using a Polyfill for older browsers.
const p = {
    ""p1"": ""value1"",
    ""p2"": ""value2"",
    ""p3"": ""value3""
};

for (let [key, value] of Object.entries(p)) {
  console.log(`${key}: ${value}`);
}

",4529,"
Under ECMAScript 5, you can combine Object.keys() and Array.prototype.forEach():
var obj = { first: ""John"", last: ""Doe"" };

Object.keys(obj).forEach(function(key) {
    console.log(key, obj[key]);
});

ECMAScript 6 adds for...of:
for (const key of Object.keys(obj)) {
    console.log(key, obj[key]);
}

ECMAScript 8 adds Object.entries() which avoids having to look up each value in the original object:
Object.entries(obj).forEach(
    ([key, value]) => console.log(key, value)
);

You can combine for...of, destructuring, and Object.entries:
for (const [key, value] of Object.entries(obj)) {
    console.log(key, value);
}

Both Object.keys() and Object.entries() iterate properties in the same order as a for...in loop but ignore the prototype chain. Only the object's own enumerable properties are iterated.

The notion that regex doesn't support inverse matching is not entirely true. You can mimic this behavior by using negative look-arounds:
^((?!hede).)*$

The regex above will match any string, or line without a line break, not containing the (sub)string 'hede'. As mentioned, this is not something regex is ""good"" at (or should do), but still, it is possible. 
And if you need to match line break chars as well, use the DOT-ALL modifier (the trailing s in the following pattern):
/^((?!hede).)*$/s

or use it inline:
/(?s)^((?!hede).)*$/

(where the /.../ are the regex delimiters, i.e., not part of the pattern)
If the DOT-ALL modifier is not available, you can mimic the same behavior with the character class [\s\S]:
/^((?!hede)[\s\S])*$/

Explanation
A string is just a list of n characters. Before, and after each character, there's an empty string. So a list of n characters will have n+1 empty strings. Consider the string ""ABhedeCD"":
    ┌──┬───┬──┬───┬──┬───┬──┬───┬──┬───┬──┬───┬──┬───┬──┬───┬──┐
S = │e1│ A │e2│ B │e3│ h │e4│ e │e5│ d │e6│ e │e7│ C │e8│ D │e9│
    └──┴───┴──┴───┴──┴───┴──┴───┴──┴───┴──┴───┴──┴───┴──┴───┴──┘

index    0      1      2      3      4      5      6      7

where the e's are the empty strings. The regex (?!hede). looks ahead to see if there's no substring ""hede"" to be seen, and if that is the case (so something else is seen), then the . (dot) will match any character except a line break. Look-arounds are also called zero-width-assertions because they don't consume any characters. They only assert/validate something. 
So, in my example, every empty string is first validated to see if there's no ""hede"" up ahead, before a character is consumed by the . (dot). The regex (?!hede). will do that only once, so it is wrapped in a group, and repeated zero or more times: ((?!hede).)*. Finally, the start- and end-of-input are anchored to make sure the entire input is consumed: ^((?!hede).)*$
As you can see, the input ""ABhedeCD"" will fail because on e3, the regex (?!hede) fails (there is ""hede"" up ahead!).
",6137,"
Note that the solution to does not start with “hede”:
^(?!hede).*$

is generally much more efficient than the solution to does not contain “hede”:
^((?!hede).)*$

The former checks for “hede” only at the input string’s first position, rather than at every position.

","120,644",78,18,php string whitespace ,https://stackoverflow.com/questions/1279774/how-can-strip-whitespaces-in-phps-variable,14,"
A regular expression does not account for UTF-8 characters by default. The \s meta-character only accounts for the original latin set. Therefore, the following command only removes tabs, spaces, carriage returns and new lines
// http://stackoverflow.com/a/1279798/54964
$str=preg_replace('/\s+/', '', $str);

With UTF-8 becoming mainstream this expression will more frequently fail/halt when it reaches the new utf-8 characters, leaving white spaces behind that the \s cannot account for.
To deal with the new types of white spaces introduced in unicode/utf-8, a more extensive string is required to match and removed modern white space.
Because regular expressions by default do not recognize multi-byte characters, only a delimited meta string can be used to identify them, to prevent the byte segments from being alters in other utf-8 characters (\x80 in the quad set could replace all \x80 sub-bytes in smart quotes)
$cleanedstr = preg_replace(
    ""/(\t|\n|\v|\f|\r| |\xC2\x85|\xc2\xa0|\xe1\xa0\x8e|\xe2\x80[\x80-\x8D]|\xe2\x80\xa8|\xe2\x80\xa9|\xe2\x80\xaF|\xe2\x81\x9f|\xe2\x81\xa0|\xe3\x80\x80|\xef\xbb\xbf)+/"",
    ""_"",
    $str
);

This accounts for and removes tabs, newlines, vertical tabs, formfeeds, carriage returns, spaces, and additionally from here: 

nextline, non-breaking spaces, mongolian vowel separator, [en quad, em quad, en space, em space, three-per-em space, four-per-em space, six-per-em space, figure space, punctuation space, thin space, hair space, zero width space, zero width non-joiner, zero width joiner], line separator, paragraph separator, narrow no-break space, medium mathematical space, word joiner, ideographical space, and the zero width non-breaking space.  

Many of these wreak havoc in xml files when exported from automated tools or sites which foul up text searches, recognition, and can be pasted invisibly into PHP source code which causes the parser to jump to next command (paragraph and line separators) which causes lines of code to be skipped resulting in intermittent, unexplained errors that we have begun referring to as ""textually transmitted diseases""

95,3357553,2010892,Storing Objects in HTML5 localStorage,"
I'd like to store a JavaScript object in HTML5 localStorage, but my object is apparently being converted to a string.
I can store and retrieve primitive JavaScript types and arrays using localStorage, but objects don't seem to work.  Should they? 
Here's my code:
var testObject = { 'one': 1, 'two': 2, 'three': 3 };
console.log('typeof testObject: ' + typeof testObject);
console.log('testObject properties:');
for (var prop in testObject) {
    console.log('  ' + prop + ': ' + testObject[prop]);
}

// Put the object into storage
localStorage.setItem('testObject', testObject);

// Retrieve the object from storage
var retrievedObject = localStorage.getItem('testObject');

console.log('typeof retrievedObject: ' + typeof retrievedObject);
console.log('Value of retrievedObject: ' + retrievedObject);

The console output is
typeof testObject: object
testObject properties:
  one: 1
  two: 2
  three: 3
typeof retrievedObject: string
Value of retrievedObject: [object Object]

It looks to me like the setItem method is converting the input to a string before storing it.
I see this behavior in Safari, Chrome, and Firefox, so I assume it's my misunderstanding of the HTML5 Web Storage spec, not a browser-specific bug or limitation.
I've tried to make sense of the structured clone algorithm described in http://www.w3.org/TR/html5/infrastructure.html.  I don't fully understand what it's saying, but maybe my problem has to do with my object's properties not being enumerable (???)  
Is there an easy workaround?

Update: The W3C eventually changed their minds about the structured-clone specification, and decided to change the spec to match the implementations.  See https://www.w3.org/Bugs/Public/show_bug.cgi?id=12111. So this question is no longer 100% valid, but the answers still may be of interest.
","1,116,885",2608,821,javascript html local-storage ,https://stackoverflow.com/questions/2010892/storing-objects-in-html5-localstorage,22,"
Looking at the Apple, Mozilla and Mozilla again documentation, the functionality seems to be limited to handle only string key/value pairs.
A workaround can be to stringify your object before storing it, and later parse it when you retrieve it:
var testObject = { 'one': 1, 'two': 2, 'three': 3 };

// Put the object into storage
localStorage.setItem('testObject', JSON.stringify(testObject));

// Retrieve the object from storage
var retrievedObject = localStorage.getItem('testObject');

console.log('retrievedObject: ', JSON.parse(retrievedObject));

",3286,"
A minor improvement on a variant:
Storage.prototype.setObject = function(key, value) {
    this.setItem(key, JSON.stringify(value));
}

Storage.prototype.getObject = function(key) {
    var value = this.getItem(key);
    return value && JSON.parse(value);
}

Because of short-circuit evaluation, getObject() will immediately return null if key is not in Storage. It also will not throw a SyntaxError exception if value is """" (the empty string; JSON.parse() cannot handle that).

96,2733873,215718,How can I reset or revert a file to a specific revision?,"
I have made some changes to a file which has been committed a few times as part of a group of files, but now want to reset/revert the changes on it back to a previous version. 
I have done a git log along with a git diff to find the revision I need, but just have no idea how to get the file back to its former state in the past.
","2,083,405",4706,1304,git version-control git-checkout ,https://stackoverflow.com/questions/215718/how-can-i-reset-or-revert-a-file-to-a-specific-revision,32,"
Assuming the hash of the commit you want is c5f567:
git checkout c5f567 -- file1/to/restore file2/to/restore

The git checkout man page gives more information.
If you want to revert to the commit before c5f567, append ~1 (where 1 is the number of commits you want to go back, it can be anything):
git checkout c5f567~1 -- file1/to/restore file2/to/restore

As a side note, I've always been uncomfortable with this command because it's used for both ordinary things (changing between branches) and unusual, destructive things (discarding changes in the working directory).
",6397,"
You can quickly review the changes made to a file using the diff command:
git diff <commit hash> <filename>

Then to revert a specific file to that commit use the reset command:
git reset <commit hash> <filename>

You may need to use the --hard option if you have local modifications.
A good workflow for managaging waypoints is to use tags to cleanly mark points in your timeline. I can't quite understand your last sentence but what you may want is diverge a branch from a previous point in time. To do this, use the handy checkout command:
git checkout <commit hash>
git checkout -b <new branch name>

You can then rebase that against your mainline when you are ready to merge those changes:
git checkout <my branch>
git rebase master
git checkout master
git merge <my branch>

97,1885525,226703,How do I prompt for Yes/No/Cancel input in a Linux shell script?,"
I want to pause input in a shell script, and prompt the user for choices.
The standard Yes, No, or Cancel type question.
How do I accomplish this in a typical bash prompt?
","1,031,014",1496,515,linux bash shell scripting ,https://stackoverflow.com/questions/226703/how-do-i-prompt-for-yes-no-cancel-input-in-a-linux-shell-script,31,"
The simplest and most widely available method to get user input at a shell prompt is the read command. The best way to illustrate its use is a simple demonstration:
while true; do
    read -p ""Do you wish to install this program?"" yn
    case $yn in
        [Yy]* ) make install; break;;
        [Nn]* ) exit;;
        * ) echo ""Please answer yes or no."";;
    esac
done

Another method, pointed out by Steven Huwig, is Bash's select command. Here is the same example using select:
echo ""Do you wish to install this program?""
select yn in ""Yes"" ""No""; do
    case $yn in
        Yes ) make install; break;;
        No ) exit;;
    esac
done

With select you don't need to sanitize the input – it displays the available choices, and you type a number corresponding to your choice. It also loops automatically, so there's no need for a while true loop to retry if they give invalid input.
Also, Léa Gris demonstrated a way to make the request language agnostic in her answer. Adapting my first example to better serve multiple languages might look like this:
set -- $(locale LC_MESSAGES)
yesptrn=""$1""; noptrn=""$2""; yesword=""$3""; noword=""$4""

while true; do
    read -p ""Install (${yesword} / ${noword})? "" yn
    case $yn in
        ${yesptrn##^} ) make install; break;;
        ${noptrn##^} ) exit;;
        * ) echo ""Answer ${yesword} / ${noword}."";;
    esac
done

Obviously other communication strings remain untranslated here (Install, Answer) which would need to be addressed in a more fully completed translation, but even a partial translation would be helpful in many cases.
Finally, please check out the excellent answer by F. Hauri.
",1677,"
At least five answers for one generic question.
Depending on

posix compliant: could work on poor systems with generic shell environments
bash specific: using so called bashisms

and if you want

simple ``in line'' question / answer (generic solutions)
pretty formatted interfaces, like ncurses or more graphical using libgtk or libqt...
use powerful readline history capability

1. POSIX generic solutions
You could use the read command, followed by if ... then ... else:
echo -n ""Is this a good question (y/n)? ""
read answer


# if echo ""$answer"" | grep -iq ""^y"" ;then


if [ ""$answer"" != ""${answer#[Yy]}"" ] ;then
    echo Yes
else
    echo No
fi

(Thanks to Adam Katz's comment: Replaced the test above with one that is more portable and avoids one fork:)
POSIX, but single key feature
But if you don't want the user to have to hit Return, you could write:
(Edited: As @JonathanLeffler rightly suggest, saving stty's configuration could be better than simply force them to sane.)
echo -n ""Is this a good question (y/n)? ""
old_stty_cfg=$(stty -g)
stty raw -echo ; answer=$(head -c 1) ; stty $old_stty_cfg # Careful playing with stty
if echo ""$answer"" | grep -iq ""^y"" ;then
    echo Yes
else
    echo No
fi

Note: This was tested under sh, bash, ksh, dash and busybox!
Same, but waiting explicitly for y or n:
#/bin/sh
echo -n ""Is this a good question (y/n)? ""
old_stty_cfg=$(stty -g)
stty raw -echo
answer=$( while ! head -c 1 | grep -i '[ny]' ;do true ;done )
stty $old_stty_cfg
if echo ""$answer"" | grep -iq ""^y"" ;then
    echo Yes
else
    echo No
fi

Using dedicated tools
There are many tools which were built using libncurses, libgtk, libqt or other graphical libraries. For example, using whiptail:
if whiptail --yesno ""Is this a good question"" 20 60 ;then
    echo Yes
else
    echo No
fi

Depending on your system, you may need to replace whiptail with another similiar tool:
dialog --yesno ""Is this a good question"" 20 60 && echo Yes

gdialog --yesno ""Is this a good question"" 20 60 && echo Yes

kdialog --yesno ""Is this a good question"" 20 60 && echo Yes

where 20 is height of dialog box in number of lines and 60 is width of  the dialog box. These tools all have near same syntax.
DIALOG=whiptail
if [ -x /usr/bin/gdialog ] ;then DIALOG=gdialog ; fi
if [ -x /usr/bin/xdialog ] ;then DIALOG=xdialog ; fi
...
$DIALOG --yesno ...

2. Bash specific solutions
Basic in line method
read -p ""Is this a good question (y/n)? "" answer
case ${answer:0:1} in
    y|Y )
        echo Yes
    ;;
    * )
        echo No
    ;;
esac

I prefer to use case so I could even test for yes | ja | si | oui if needed...
in line with single key feature
Under bash, we can specify the length of intended input for for the read command:
read -n 1 -p ""Is this a good question (y/n)? "" answer

Under bash, read command accepts a timeout parameter, which could be useful.
read -t 3 -n 1 -p ""Is this a good question (y/n)? "" answer
[ -z ""$answer"" ] && answer=""Yes""  # if 'yes' have to be default choice

3.  Some tricks for dedicated tools
More sophisticated dialog boxes, beyond simple yes - no purposes:
dialog --menu ""Is this a good question"" 20 60 12 y Yes n No m Maybe

Progress bar:
dialog --gauge ""Filling the tank"" 20 60 0 < <(
    for i in {1..100};do
        printf ""XXX\n%d\n%(%a %b %T)T progress: %d\nXXX\n"" $i -1 $i
        sleep .033
    done
) 

Little demo:
#!/bin/sh
while true ;do
    [ -x ""$(which ${DIALOG%% *})"" ] || DIALOG=dialog
    DIALOG=$($DIALOG --menu ""Which tool for next run?"" 20 60 12 2>&1 \

5. Using readline's history
Example:
#!/bin/bash

set -i
HISTFILE=~/.myscript.history
history -c
history -r

myread() {
    read -e -p '> ' $1
    history -s ${!1}
}
trap 'history -a;exit' 0 1 2 3 6

while myread line;do
    case ${line%% *} in
        exit )  break ;;
        *    )  echo ""Doing something with '$line'"" ;;
      esac
  done

This will create a file .myscript.history in your $HOME directory, than you could use readline's history commands, like Up,  Down, Ctrl+r and others.

for (int n = 0; n < 10; n++) {
   sb.append(""a"");

   // This will clear the buffer
   sb.delete(0, sb.length());

It looks to me like you really want to print out the names of each enum, rather than the values. In which case Enum.GetNames() seems to be the right approach.

By the way, incrementing the value is not a good way to enumerate the values of an enum. You should do this instead.

@JsonIgnoreProperties

It will ignore every property you haven't defined in your POJO. Very useful when you are just looking for a couple of properties in the JSON and don't want to write the whole mapping. More info at Jackson's website. If you want to ignore any non declared property, you should write:

To fix the actual problem you should try to either run the Java code with a newer version of Java JRE or specify the target parameter to the Java compiler to instruct the compiler to create code compatible with earlier Java versions. 
For example, in order to generate class files compatible with Java 1.4, use the following command line:

To break a $.each or $(selector).each loop, you have to return false in the loop callback.
Returning true skips to the next  iteration, equivalent to a continue in a normal loop.
$.each(array, function(key, value) { 
    if(value === ""foo"") {
        return false; // breaks
    }
});

// or

$(selector).each(function() {
  if (condition) {
    return false;
  }
});

",1235,"
According to the documentation return false; should do the job. 

We can break the $.each() loop [..] by making the callback function
  return false.

Return false in the callback:
function callback(indexInArray, valueOfElement) {
  var booleanKeepGoing;

  this; // == valueOfElement (casted to Object)

  return booleanKeepGoing; // optional, unless false 
                           // and want to stop looping
}

BTW, continue works like this:

Returning non-false is the same as a continue statement in a for loop; it will skip immediately to the next iteration.

Say I have a class that's meant to perform a single function. After performing the function, it can be destroyed. Is there any reason to prefer one of these approaches?
// Initialize arguments in constructor
MyClass myObject = new MyClass(arg1, arg2, arg3);
myObject.myMethod();

// Pass arguments to method
MyClass myObject = new MyClass();
myObject.myMethod(arg1, arg2, arg3);

// Pass arguments to static method
MyClass.myMethod(arg1, arg2, arg3);

I was being intentionally vague about the details, to try to get guidelines for different situations. But I didn't really have in mind simple library functions like Math.random(). I'm thinking more of classes that perform some specific, complex task, but only require one (public) method to do it.
","84,614",176,108,c# java oop static-methods ,https://stackoverflow.com/questions/205689/class-with-single-method-best-approach,15,"
I used to love utility classes filled up with static methods. They made a great consolidation of helper methods that would otherwise lie around causing redundancy and maintenance hell. They're very easy to use, no instantiation, no disposal, just fire'n'forget. I guess this was my first unwitting attempt at creating a service oriented architecture - lots of stateless services that just did their job and nothing else. As a system grows however, dragons be coming.
Polymorphism
Say we have the method UtilityClass.SomeMethod that happily buzzes along. Suddenly we need to change the functionality slightly. Most of the functionality is the same, but we have to change a couple of parts nonetheless. Had it not been a static method, we could make a derivate class and change the method contents as needed. As it's a static method, we can't. Sure, if we just need to add functionality either before or after the old method, we can create a new class and call the old one inside of it - but that's just gross.
Interface woes
Static methods cannot be defined through interfaces for logic reasons. And since we can't override static methods, static classes are useless when we need to pass them around by their interface. This renders us unable to use static classes as part of a strategy pattern. We might patch some issues up by passing delegates instead of interfaces.
Testing
This basically goes hand in hand with the interface woes mentioned above. As our ability of interchanging implementations is very limited, we'll also have trouble replacing production code with test code. Again, we can wrap them up but it'll require us to change large parts of our code just to be able to accept wrappers instead of the actual objects.
Fosters blobs
As static methods are usually used as utility methods and utility methods usually will have different purposes, we'll quickly end up with a large class filled up with non-coherent functionality - ideally, each class should have a single purpose within the system. I'd much rather have a five times the classes as long as their purposes are well defined.
Parameter creep
To begin with, that little cute and innocent static method might take a single parameter. As functionality grows, a couple of new parameters are added. Soon further parameters are added that are optional, so we create overloads of the method (or just add default values, in languages that support them). Before long, we have a method that takes 10 parameters. Only the first three are really required, parameters 4-7 are optional. But if parameter 6 is specified, 7-9 are required to be filled in as well... Had we created a class with the single purpose of doing what this static method did, we could solve this by taking in the required parameters in the constructor, and allowing the user to set optional values through properties, or methods to set multiple interdependent values at the same time. Also, if a method has grown to this amount of complexity, it most likely needs to be in its own class anyways.
Demanding consumers to create an instance of classes for no reason
One of the most common arguments is, why demand that consumers of our class create an instance for invoking this single method, while having no use for the instance afterwards? Creating an instance of a class is a very very cheap operation in most languages, so speed is not an issue. Adding an extra line of code to the consumer is a low cost for laying the foundation of a much more maintainable solution in the future. And finally, if you want to avoid creating instances, simply create a singleton wrapper of your class that allows for easy reuse - although this does make the requirement that your class is stateless. If it's not stateless, you can still create static wrapper methods that handle everything, while still giving you all the benefits in the long run. Finally, you could also make a class that hides the instantiation as if it was a singleton: MyWrapper.Instance is a property that just returns new MyClass();
Only a Sith deals in absolutes
Of course, there are exceptions to my dislike of static methods. True utility classes that do not pose any risk to bloat are excellent cases for static methods - System.Convert as an example. If your project is a one-off with no requirements for future maintenance, the overall architecture really isn't very important - static or non static, doesn't really matter - development speed does, however.
Standards, standards, standards!
Using instance methods does not inhibit you from also using static methods, and vice versa. As long as there's reasoning behind the differentiation and it's standardised. There's nothing worse than looking over a business layer sprawling with different implementation methods.
",264,"

Modern browsers have Array#includes, which does exactly that and is widely supported by everyone except IE:


console.log(['joe', 'jane', 'mary'].includes('jane')); //true



For internet explorer you can use below function to check an array include a value:


function includes(container, value) {
    var returnValue = false;
    var pos = container.indexOf(value);
    if (pos >= 0) {
        returnValue = true;
    }
    return returnValue;
}
//examples---------
console.log(includes([1,2,3],2))
console.log(includes([1,2,3],'a'))
console.log(includes(""abc"",'a'))
console.log(includes(""abc"",'e'))



You can also use Array#indexOf, which is less direct, but doesn't require polyfills for outdated browsers.

Many frameworks also offer similar methods:

jQuery: $.inArray(value, array, [fromIndex])
Underscore.js: _.contains(array, value) (also aliased as _.include and _.includes)
Dojo Toolkit: dojo.indexOf(array, value, [fromIndex, findLast])
Prototype: array.indexOf(value)
MooTools: array.indexOf(value)
MochiKit: findValue(array, value)
MS Ajax: array.indexOf(value)
Ext: Ext.Array.contains(array, value)
Lodash: _.includes(array, value, [from]) (is _.contains prior 4.0.0)
Ramda: R.includes(value, array)

Notice that some frameworks implement this as a function, while others add the function to the array prototype.
",4567,"
Update from 2019: This answer is from 2008 (11 years old!) and is not relevant for modern JS usage. The promised performance improvement was based on a benchmark done in browsers of that time. It might not be relevant to modern JS execution contexts. If you need an easy solution, look for other answers. If you need the best performance, benchmark for yourself in the relevant execution environments.
As others have said, the iteration through the array is probably the best way, but it has been proven that a decreasing while loop is the fastest way to iterate in JavaScript. So you may want to rewrite your code as follows:
function contains(a, obj) {
    var i = a.length;
    while (i--) {
       if (a[i] === obj) {
           return true;
       }
    }
    return false;
}

Of course, you may as well extend Array prototype:
Array.prototype.contains = function(obj) {
    var i = this.length;
    while (i--) {
        if (this[i] === obj) {
            return true;
        }
    }
    return false;
}

And now you can simply use the following:
alert([1, 2, 3].contains(2)); // => true
alert([1, 2, 3].contains('2')); // => false

You can convert, but I don't think there's anything built in to do it automatically:

{
    int[] ret = new int[integers.size()];
    for (int i=0; i < ret.length; i++)

    }
    return ret;

EDIT: As per comments, you may want to use the list iterator to avoid nasty costs with lists such as LinkedList:
public static int[] convertIntegers(List<Integer> integers)
{
    int[] ret = new int[integers.size()];
    Iterator<Integer> iterator = integers.iterator();
    for (int i = 0; i < ret.length; i++)
    {
        ret[i] = iterator.next().intValue();
    }
    return ret;
}

",228,"
If you are using java-8 there's also another way to do this.
int[] arr = list.stream().mapToInt(i -> i).toArray();

What it does is:

getting a Stream<Integer> from the list
obtaining an IntStream by mapping each element to itself (identity function), unboxing the int value hold by each Integer object (done automatically since Java 5)
getting the array of int by calling toArray

You could also explicitly call intValue via a method reference, i.e:
int[] arr = list.stream().mapToInt(Integer::intValue).toArray();

It's also worth mentioning that you could get a NullPointerException if you have any null reference in the list. This could be easily avoided by adding a filtering condition to the stream pipeline like this:
                       //.filter(Objects::nonNull) also works
int[] arr = list.stream().filter(i -> i != null).mapToInt(i -> i).toArray();

Example:
List<Integer> list = Arrays.asList(1, 2, 3, 4);
int[] arr = list.stream().mapToInt(i -> i).toArray(); //[1, 2, 3, 4]

list.set(1, null); //[1, null, 3, 4]
arr = list.stream().filter(i -> i != null).mapToInt(i -> i).toArray(); //[1, 3, 4]

Note that Iterator.remove() is the only safe way to modify a collection during iteration; the behavior is unspecified if the underlying collection is modified in any other way while the iteration is in progress.
Source: docs.oracle > The Collection Interface

And similarly, if you have a ListIterator and want to add items, you can use ListIterator#add, for the same reason you can use Iterator#remove — it's designed to allow it.

In your case you tried to remove from a list, but the same restriction applies if trying to put into a Map while iterating its content.

108,28065267,23935810,Mipmap drawables for icons,"
Since Android 4.3 (Jelly Bean) we can now make use of the res/mipmap folders to store ""mipmap"" images.
For example, Chrome for Android stores its icons in these folders instead of the more normal res/drawable folders.
How are these mipmap images different from the other familiar drawable images?
I see that in my manifest, we use the @mipmap/ qualifier, instead of @drawable/, which makes sense given the resource folder name:
<activity
    android:name="".MipmapDemp""
    android:icon=""@mipmap/ic_launcher"" />


References:
The Android 4.3 APIs document has the following to say:

I don't see anything in there that helps me to understand.

XML Bitmap resources have an android:mipMap property:

Boolean. Enables or disables the mipmap hint. See setHasMipMap() for
  more information. Default value is false.

This does not apply to launcher icons as far as I can see.

The question was raised on Google Groups (The purpose of resource name ""mipmap""?!), to which Romain Guy replied:

It's useful to provide an image at a larger resolution that would
  normally be computed (for instance, on an mdpi device, Launcher might
  want the larger hdpi icon to display large app shortcuts.)

I feel like this almost makes sense of it, but not quite.
I'm still inclined to go with Randy Sugianto's follow up:

What are the advantages of this? Is there any guide how to use
  mipmaps, probably for better launcher icons?


Of course, Wikipedia has a page for ""Mipmap"", which refers to an older technique invented in 1983, that I can't quite relate to the current Android implementation.

Should we be storing all our app icons in res/mipmap folders these days, and what are the guidelines for these mipmap images?

Update #1
Here's a blog post that tries to explain it a bit.

Mipmapping for drawables in Android 4.3

But the image used in that blog post shows what looks like one file with many logos in it. This is not what I see in Chrome's mipmap folder.
Chrome's mipmap-hdpi folder contains three images. One is the Chrome logo, on its own.

Strangely, it is 72x72, not 48x48 which I would expect to see.
Perhaps that is all there is to this - we just need to keep bigger icons in the mipmap folders?

Update #2
The Android Developers Blog post of 23/10/2014 again confirms the idea of using the mipmap folders for application icons:

Getting Your Apps Ready for Nexus 6 and Nexus 9

When talking about the Nexus 6 screen density, the author writes:

It’s best practice to place your app icons in mipmap- folders (not the
  drawable- folders) because they are used at resolutions different from
  the device’s current density. For example, an xxxhdpi app icon can be
  used on the launcher for an xxhdpi device.


Update #3
Note that Android Studio creates the ic_launcher.png icons in the mipmap... folders rather than the drawable... folders that Eclipse used to create them in.

","185,415",453,122,android android-drawable mipmaps ,https://stackoverflow.com/questions/23935810/mipmap-drawables-for-icons,11,"
There are two distinct uses of mipmaps:

For launcher icons when building density specific APKs. Some developers build separate APKs for every density, to keep the APK size down. However some launchers (shipped with some devices, or available on the Play Store) use larger icon sizes than the standard 48dp. Launchers use getDrawableForDensity and scale down if needed, rather than up, so the icons are high quality. For example on an hdpi tablet the launcher might load the xhdpi icon. By placing your launcher icon in the mipmap-xhdpi directory, it will not be stripped the way a drawable-xhdpi directory is when building an APK for hdpi devices. If you're building a single APK for all devices, then this doesn't really matter as the launcher can access the drawable resources for the desired density.
The actual mipmap API from 4.3. I haven't used this and am not familiar with it. It's not used by the Android Open Source Project launchers and I'm not aware of any other launcher using.

",262,"
It seems Google have updated their docs since all these answers, so hopefully this will help someone else in future :) Just came across this question myself, while creating a new (new new) project.
TL;DR: drawables may be stripped out as part of dp-specific resource optimisation. Mipmaps will not be stripped.

Different home screen launcher apps on different devices show app launcher icons at various resolutions. When app resource optimization techniques remove resources for unused screen densities, launcher icons can wind up looking fuzzy because the launcher app has to upscale a lower-resolution icon for display. To avoid these display issues, apps should use the mipmap/ resource folders for launcher icons. The Android system preserves these resources regardless of density stripping, and ensures that launcher apps can pick icons with the best resolution for display.

This depends a lot on what you mean by ""revert"".
Temporarily switch to a different commit
If you want to temporarily go back to it, fool around, then come back to where you are, all you have to do is check out the desired commit:
# This will detach your HEAD, that is, leave you with no branch checked out:
git checkout 0d1d7fc32

Or if you want to make commits while you're there, go ahead and make a new branch while you're at it:
git checkout -b old-state 0d1d7fc32

To go back to where you were, just check out the branch you were on again. (If you've made changes, as always when switching branches, you'll have to deal with them as appropriate. You could reset to throw them away; you could stash, checkout, stash pop to take them with you; you could commit them to a branch there if you want a branch there.)
Hard delete unpublished commits
If, on the other hand, you want to really get rid of everything you've done since then, there are two possibilities. One, if you haven't published any of these commits, simply reset:
# This will destroy any local modifications.
# Don't do it if you have uncommitted work you want to keep.
git reset --hard 0d1d7fc32

# Alternatively, if there's work to keep:
git stash
git reset --hard 0d1d7fc32
git stash pop
# This saves the modifications, then reapplies that patch after resetting.
# You could get merge conflicts, if you've modified things which were
# changed since the commit you reset to.

If you mess up, you've already thrown away your local changes, but you can at least get back to where you were before by resetting again.
Undo published commits with new commits
On the other hand, if you've published the work, you probably don't want to reset the branch, since that's effectively rewriting history. In that case, you could indeed revert the commits. With Git, revert has a very specific meaning: create a commit with the reverse patch to cancel it out. This way you don't rewrite any history.
# This will create three separate revert commits:
git revert a867b4af 25eee4ca 0766c053

# It also takes ranges. This will revert the last two commits:
git revert HEAD~2..HEAD

#Similarly, you can revert a range of commits using commit hashes (non inclusive of first hash):
git revert 0d1d7fc..a867b4a

# Reverting a merge commit
git revert -m 1 <merge_commit_sha>

# To get just one, you could use `rebase -i` to squash them afterwards
# Or, you could do it manually (be sure to do this at top level of the repo)
# get your index and work tree into the desired state, without changing HEAD:
git checkout 0d1d7fc32 .

# Then commit. Be sure and write a good message describing what you just did
git commit

The git-revert manpage actually covers a lot of this in its description. Another useful link is this git-scm.com section discussing git-revert.
If you decide you didn't want to revert after all, you can revert the revert (as described here) or reset back to before the revert (see the previous section).
You may also find this answer helpful in this case:
How can I move HEAD back to a previous location? (Detached head) & Undo commits
",10140,"
Lots of complicated and dangerous answers here, but it's actually easy:
git revert --no-commit 0766c053..HEAD
git commit

This will revert everything from the HEAD back to the commit hash, meaning it will recreate that commit state in the working tree as if every commit after 0766c053 had been walked back. You can then commit the current tree, and it will create a brand new commit essentially equivalent to the commit you ""reverted"" to.  
(The --no-commit flag lets git revert all the commits at once- otherwise you'll be prompted for a message for each commit in the range, littering your history with unnecessary new commits.)
This is a safe and easy way to rollback to a previous state. No history is destroyed, so it can be used for commits that have already been made public.

How can I change the class of an HTML element in response to an onclick or any other events using JavaScript?
","2,692,674",2859,754,javascript html dom ,https://stackoverflow.com/questions/195951/how-can-i-change-an-elements-class-with-javascript,32,"
Modern HTML5 Techniques for changing classes
Modern browsers have added classList which provides methods to make it easier to manipulate classes without needing a library:
document.getElementById(""MyElement"").classList.add('MyClass');

document.getElementById(""MyElement"").classList.remove('MyClass');

if ( document.getElementById(""MyElement"").classList.contains('MyClass') )

document.getElementById(""MyElement"").classList.toggle('MyClass');

Unfortunately, these do not work in Internet Explorer prior to v10, though there is a shim to add support for it to IE8 and IE9, available from this page. It is, though, getting more and more supported.
Simple cross-browser solution
The standard JavaScript way to select an element is using document.getElementById(""Id""), which is what the following examples use - you can of course obtain elements in other ways, and in the right situation may simply use this instead - however, going into detail on this is beyond the scope of the answer.
To change all classes for an element:
To replace all existing classes with one or more new classes, set the className attribute:
document.getElementById(""MyElement"").className = ""MyClass"";

(You can use a space-delimited list to apply multiple classes.)
To add an additional class to an element:
To add a class to an element, without removing/affecting existing values, append a space and the new classname, like so:
document.getElementById(""MyElement"").className += "" MyClass"";

To remove a class from an element:
To remove a single class to an element, without affecting other potential classes, a simple regex replace is required:
document.getElementById(""MyElement"").className =
   document.getElementById(""MyElement"").className.replace
      ( /(?:^|\s)MyClass(?!\S)/g , '' )
/* Code wrapped for readability - above is all one statement */

An explanation of this regex is as follows:
(?:^|\s) # Match the start of the string, or any single whitespace character

MyClass  # The literal text for the classname to remove

(?!\S)   # Negative lookahead to verify the above is the whole classname
         # Ensures there is no non-space character following
         # (i.e. must be end of string or a space)

The g flag tells the replace to repeat as required, in case the class name has been added multiple times.
To check if a class is already applied to an element:
The same regex used above for removing a class can also be used as a check as to whether a particular class exists:
if ( document.getElementById(""MyElement"").className.match(/(?:^|\s)MyClass(?!\S)/) )


Assigning these actions to onclick events:
Whilst it is possible to write JavaScript directly inside the HTML event attributes (such as onclick=""this.className+=' MyClass'"") this is not recommended behaviour. Especially on larger applications, more maintainable code is achieved by separating HTML markup from JavaScript interaction logic.
The first step to achieving this is by creating a function, and calling the function in the onclick attribute, for example:
<script type=""text/javascript"">
    function changeClass(){
        // Code examples from above
    }
</script>
...
<button onclick=""changeClass()"">My Button</button>

(It is not required to have this code in script tags, this is simply for brevity of example, and including the JavaScript in a distinct file may be more appropriate.)
The second step is to move the onclick event out of the HTML and into JavaScript, for example using addEventListener
<script type=""text/javascript"">
    function changeClass(){
        // Code examples from above
    }

    window.onload = function(){
        document.getElementById(""MyElement"").addEventListener( 'click', changeClass);
    }
</script>
...
<button id=""MyElement"">My Button</button>

(Note that the window.onload part is required so that the contents of that function are executed after the HTML has finished loading - without this, the MyElement might not exist when the JavaScript code is called, so that line would fail.)

JavaScript Frameworks and Libraries
The above code is all in standard JavaScript, however it is common practise to use either a framework or a library to simplify common tasks, as well as benefit from fixed bugs and edge cases that you might not think of when writing your code.
Whilst some people consider it overkill to add a ~50 KB framework for simply changing a class, if you are doing any substantial amount of JavaScript work, or anything that might have unusual cross-browser behaviour, it is well worth considering.
(Very roughly, a library is a set of tools designed for a specific task, whilst a framework generally contains multiple libraries and performs a complete set of duties.)
The examples above have been reproduced below using jQuery, probably the most commonly used JavaScript library (though there are others worth investigating too).
(Note that $ here is the jQuery object.)
Changing Classes with jQuery:
$('#MyElement').addClass('MyClass');

$('#MyElement').removeClass('MyClass');

if ( $('#MyElement').hasClass('MyClass') )

In addition, jQuery provides a shortcut for adding a class if it doesn't apply, or removing a class that does:
$('#MyElement').toggleClass('MyClass');


Assigning a function to a click event with jQuery:
$('#MyElement').click(changeClass);

or, without needing an id:
$(':button:contains(My Button)').click(changeClass);


",3990,"
You could also just do:
document.getElementById('id').classList.add('class');
document.getElementById('id').classList.remove('class');

And to toggle a class (remove if exists else add it):
document.getElementById('id').classList.toggle('class');

Modern jQuery
Use .prop():
$('.myCheckbox').prop('checked', true);
$('.myCheckbox').prop('checked', false);

DOM API
If you're working with just one element, you can always just access the underlying HTMLInputElement and modify its .checked property:
$('.myCheckbox')[0].checked = true;
$('.myCheckbox')[0].checked = false;

The benefit to using the .prop() and .attr() methods instead of this is that they will operate on all matched elements.
jQuery 1.5.x and below
The .prop() method is not available, so you need to use .attr().
$('.myCheckbox').attr('checked', true);
$('.myCheckbox').attr('checked', false);

Note that this is the approach used by jQuery's unit tests prior to version 1.6 and is preferable to using $('.myCheckbox').removeAttr('checked'); since the latter will, if the box was initially checked, change the behaviour of a call to .reset() on any form that contains it – a subtle but probably unwelcome behaviour change.
For more context, some incomplete discussion of the changes to the handling of the checked attribute/property in the transition from 1.5.x to 1.6 can be found in the version 1.6 release notes and the Attributes vs. Properties section of the .prop() documentation.

Add this to the beginning of the script:

This will cause the shell to exit immediately if a simple command exits with a nonzero exit value.  A simple command is any command not part of an if, while, or until test, or part of an && or || list.
See the bash(1) man page on the ""set"" internal command for more details.
I personally start almost all shell scripts with ""set -e"".  It's really annoying to have a script stubbornly continue when something fails in the middle and breaks assumptions for the rest of the script.

To add to the accepted answer: 
Bear in mind that set -e sometimes is not enough, specially if you have pipes. 
For example, suppose you have this script
#!/bin/bash
set -e

make

... which works as expected: an error in configure aborts the execution.
Tomorrow you make a seemingly trivial change:
#!/bin/bash
set -e 
./configure  | tee configure.log
make

... and now it does not work. This is explained here, and a workaround (Bash only) is provided:

        if (a[i] === obj) {

Modern browsers have Array#includes, which does exactly that and is widely supported by everyone except IE:


console.log(['joe', 'jane', 'mary'].includes('jane')); //true



For internet explorer you can use below function to check an array include a value:


function includes(container, value) {
    var returnValue = false;
    var pos = container.indexOf(value);
    if (pos >= 0) {
        returnValue = true;
    }
    return returnValue;
}
//examples---------
console.log(includes([1,2,3],2))
console.log(includes([1,2,3],'a'))
console.log(includes(""abc"",'a'))
console.log(includes(""abc"",'e'))



You can also use Array#indexOf, which is less direct, but doesn't require polyfills for outdated browsers.

Many frameworks also offer similar methods:

jQuery: $.inArray(value, array, [fromIndex])
Underscore.js: _.contains(array, value) (also aliased as _.include and _.includes)
Dojo Toolkit: dojo.indexOf(array, value, [fromIndex, findLast])
Prototype: array.indexOf(value)
MooTools: array.indexOf(value)
MochiKit: findValue(array, value)
MS Ajax: array.indexOf(value)
Ext: Ext.Array.contains(array, value)
Lodash: _.includes(array, value, [from]) (is _.contains prior 4.0.0)
Ramda: R.includes(value, array)

Notice that some frameworks implement this as a function, while others add the function to the array prototype.
",4567,"
Update from 2019: This answer is from 2008 (11 years old!) and is not relevant for modern JS usage. The promised performance improvement was based on a benchmark done in browsers of that time. It might not be relevant to modern JS execution contexts. If you need an easy solution, look for other answers. If you need the best performance, benchmark for yourself in the relevant execution environments.
As others have said, the iteration through the array is probably the best way, but it has been proven that a decreasing while loop is the fastest way to iterate in JavaScript. So you may want to rewrite your code as follows:
function contains(a, obj) {
    var i = a.length;
    while (i--) {
       if (a[i] === obj) {
           return true;
       }
    }
    return false;
}

Of course, you may as well extend Array prototype:
Array.prototype.contains = function(obj) {
    var i = this.length;
    while (i--) {
        if (this[i] === obj) {
            return true;
        }
    }
    return false;
}

And now you can simply use the following:
alert([1, 2, 3].contains(2)); // => true
alert([1, 2, 3].contains('2')); // => false

And then make changes to the new object that are not reflected in the original object.
I don't often need this functionality, so when it's been necessary, I've resorted to creating a new object and then copying each property individually, but it always leaves me with the feeling that there is a better or more elegant way of handling the situation.
How can I clone or deep copy an object so that the cloned object can be modified without any changes being reflected in the original object?
","835,488",2293,636,c# .net clone ,https://stackoverflow.com/questions/78536/deep-cloning-objects,48,"
Whilst the standard practice is to implement the ICloneable interface (described here, so I won't regurgitate), here's a nice deep clone object copier I found on The Code Project a while ago and incorporated it in our stuff.
As mentioned elsewhere, it requires your objects to be serializable.
using System;
using System.IO;
using System.Runtime.Serialization;
using System.Runtime.Serialization.Formatters.Binary;

/// <summary>
/// Reference Article http://www.codeproject.com/KB/tips/SerializedObjectCloner.aspx
/// Provides a method for performing a deep copy of an object.
/// Binary Serialization is used to perform the copy.

{
    /// <summary>

    /// </summary>
    /// <typeparam name=""T"">The type of object being copied.</typeparam>
    /// <param name=""source"">The object instance to copy.</param>
    /// <returns>The copied object.</returns>
    public static T Clone<T>(T source)
    {
        if (!typeof(T).IsSerializable)
        {
            throw new ArgumentException(""The type must be serializable."", nameof(source));
        }

        // Don't serialize a null object, simply return the default for that object
        if (Object.ReferenceEquals(source, null))
        {
            return default(T);
        }

        IFormatter formatter = new BinaryFormatter();
        Stream stream = new MemoryStream();
        using (stream)
        {
            formatter.Serialize(stream, source);
            stream.Seek(0, SeekOrigin.Begin);
            return (T)formatter.Deserialize(stream);
        }
    }
}

The idea is that, it serializes your object and then deserializes it into a fresh object. The benefit is that you don't have to concern yourself about cloning everything when an object gets too complex.
And with the use of extension methods (also from the originally referenced source):
In case of you prefer to use the new extension methods of C# 3.0, change the method to have the following signature:
public static T Clone<T>(this T source)
{
   //...
}

Now the method call simply becomes objectBeingCloned.Clone();.
EDIT (January 10 2015) Thought I'd revisit this, to mention I recently started using (Newtonsoft) Json to do this, it should be lighter, and avoids the overhead of [Serializable] tags. (NB @atconway has pointed out in the comments that private members are not cloned using the JSON method)
/// <summary>
/// Perform a deep Copy of the object, using Json as a serialization method. NOTE: Private members are not cloned using this method.

/// <returns>The copied object.</returns>
public static T CloneJson<T>(this T source)
{            
    // Don't serialize a null object, simply return the default for that object
    if (Object.ReferenceEquals(source, null))
    {
        return default(T);
    }

    // initialize inner objects individually
    // for example in default constructor some list property initialized with some values,
    // but in 'source' these items are cleaned -
    // without ObjectCreationHandling.Replace default constructor values will be added to result
    var deserializeSettings = new JsonSerializerSettings {ObjectCreationHandling = ObjectCreationHandling.Replace};

    return JsonConvert.DeserializeObject<T>(JsonConvert.SerializeObject(source), deserializeSettings);
}

",1757,"
I wanted a cloner for very simple objects of mostly primitives and lists.  If your object is out of the box JSON serializable then this method will do the trick.  This requires no modification or implementation of interfaces on the cloned class, just a JSON serializer like JSON.NET.
public static T Clone<T>(T source)
{
    var serialized = JsonConvert.SerializeObject(source);
    return JsonConvert.DeserializeObject<T>(serialized);
}

Also, you can use this extension method
public static class SystemExtension
{
    public static T Clone<T>(this T source)
    {

        return JsonConvert.DeserializeObject<T>(serialized);

How do I read a file into a std::string, i.e., read the whole file at once?
Text or binary mode should be specified by the caller. The solution should be standard-compliant, portable and efficient. It should not needlessly copy the string's data, and it should avoid reallocations of memory while reading the string.
One way to do this would be to stat the filesize, resize the std::string and fread() into the std::string's const_cast<char*>()'ed data(). This requires the std::string's data to be contiguous which is not required by the standard, but it appears to be the case for all known implementations. What is worse, if the file is read in text mode, the std::string's size may not equal the file's size.
A fully correct, standard-compliant and portable solutions could be constructed using std::ifstream's rdbuf() into a std::ostringstream and from there into a std::string. However, this could copy the string data and/or needlessly reallocate memory. 

Are all relevant standard library implementations smart enough to avoid all unnecessary overhead?

std::string slurp(std::ifstream& in) {
    std::ostringstream sstr;
    sstr << in.rdbuf();
    return sstr.str();
}

This is nicely concise. However, as noted in the question this performs a redundant copy and unfortunately there is fundamentally no way of eliding this copy.
The only real solution that avoids redundant copies is to do the reading manually in a loop, unfortunately. Since C++ now has guaranteed contiguous strings, one could write the following (≥C++14):
auto read_file(std::string_view path) -> std::string {
    constexpr auto read_size = std::size_t{4096};
    auto stream = std::ifstream{path.data()};
    stream.exceptions(std::ios_base::badbit);

    auto out = std::string{};
    auto buf = std::string(read_size, '\0');
    while (stream.read(& buf[0], read_size)) {
        out.append(buf, 0, stream.gcount());
    }
    out.append(buf, 0, stream.gcount());
    return out;
}

A visual answer
Imagine a <span> element inside a <div>. If you give the <span> element a height of 100px and a red border for example, it will look like this with
display: inline

display: inline-block

display: block

Code: http://jsfiddle.net/Mta2b/
Elements with display:inline-block are like display:inline elements, but they can have a width and a height. That means that you can use an inline-block element as a block while flowing it within text or other elements.
Difference of supported styles as summary:

inline: only margin-left, margin-right, padding-left, padding-right
inline-block: margin, padding, height, width

",1373,"
display: inline; is a display mode to use in a sentence. For instance, if you have a paragraph and want to highlight a single word you do:
<p>
    Pellentesque habitant morbi <em>tristique</em> senectus
    et netus et malesuada fames ac turpis egestas.
</p>

The <em> element has a display: inline; by default, because this tag is always used in a sentence.
The <p> element has a display: block; by default, because it's neither a sentence nor in a sentence, it's a block of sentences.
An element with display: inline; cannot have a height or a width or a vertical margin. An element with display: block; can have a width, height and margin.
If you want to add a height to the <em> element, you need to set this element to display: inline-block;. Now you can add a height to the element and every other block style (the block part of inline-block), but it is placed in a sentence (the inline part of inline-block).

Here is a quick and dirty implementation of datediff, as a proof of concept to solve the problem as presented in the question. It relies on the fact that you can get the elapsed milliseconds between two dates by subtracting them, which coerces them into their primitive number value (milliseconds since the start of 1970). 


// new Date(""dateString"") is browser-dependent and discouraged, so we'll write
// a simple parse function for U.S. date format (which does no error checking)
function parseDate(str) {
    var mdy = str.split('/');
    return new Date(mdy[2], mdy[0]-1, mdy[1]);
}

function datediff(first, second) {
    // Take the difference between the dates and divide by milliseconds per day.
    // Round to nearest whole number to deal with DST.
    return Math.round((second-first)/(1000*60*60*24));
}

alert(datediff(parseDate(first.value), parseDate(second.value)));
<input id=""first"" value=""1/1/2000""/>
<input id=""second"" value=""1/1/2001""/>



You should be aware that the ""normal"" Date APIs (without ""UTC"" in the name) operate in the local timezone of the user's browser, so in general you could run into issues if your user is in a timezone that you don't expect, and your code will have to deal with Daylight Saving Time transitions. You should carefully read the documentation for the Date object and its methods, and for anything more complicated, strongly consider using a library that offers more safe and powerful APIs for date manipulation.

N = 86400000

Although Math.round returns the correct results, I think it's somewhat clunky. Instead, by explicitly accounting for changes to the UTC offset when DST begins or ends, we can use exact arithmetic:
function treatAsUTC(date) {
    var result = new Date(date);
    result.setMinutes(result.getMinutes() - result.getTimezoneOffset());
    return result;
}

function daysBetween(startDate, endDate) {
    var millisecondsPerDay = 24 * 60 * 60 * 1000;
    return (treatAsUTC(endDate) - treatAsUTC(startDate)) / millisecondsPerDay;
}

alert(daysBetween($('#first').val(), $('#second').val()));

Explanation
JavaScript date calculations are tricky because Date objects store times internally in UTC, not local time. For example, 3/10/2013 12:00 AM Pacific Standard Time (UTC-08:00) is stored as 3/10/2013 8:00 AM UTC, and 3/11/2013 12:00 AM Pacific Daylight Time (UTC-07:00) is stored as 3/11/2013 7:00 AM UTC. On this day, midnight to midnight local time is only 23 hours in UTC!
Although a day in local time can have more or less than 24 hours, a day in UTC is always exactly 24 hours.1 The daysBetween method shown above takes advantage of this fact by first calling treatAsUTC to adjust both local times to midnight UTC, before subtracting and dividing.

Some browsers will need vendor prefixes.  For older browsers without flexbox support (e.g. IE 9 and lower), you'll need to implement a fallback solution using one of the older methods.

When you add the const keyword to a method the this pointer will essentially become a pointer to const object, and you cannot therefore change any member data. (Unless you use mutable, more on that later).
The const keyword is part of the functions signature which means that you can implement two similar methods, one which is called when the object is const, and one that isn't.
#include <iostream>

class MyClass
{
private:
    int counter;
public:
    void Foo()
    { 
        std::cout << ""Foo"" << std::endl;    
    }

    void Foo() const
    {
        std::cout << ""Foo const"" << std::endl;
    }

};

int main()
{
    MyClass cc;
    const MyClass& ccc = cc;
    cc.Foo();
    ccc.Foo();
}

This will output
Foo
Foo const

In the non-const method you can change the instance members, which you cannot do in the const version. If you change the method declaration in the above example to the code below you will get some errors.
    void Foo()
    {
        counter++; //this works
        std::cout << ""Foo"" << std::endl;    
    }

    void Foo() const
    {
        counter++; //this will not compile
        std::cout << ""Foo const"" << std::endl;
    }

This is not completely true, because you can mark a member as mutable and a const method can then change it. It's mostly used for internal counters and stuff. The solution for that would be the below code.
#include <iostream>

class MyClass
{
private:
    mutable int counter;
public:

    MyClass() : counter(0) {}

    void Foo()
    {
        counter++;
        std::cout << ""Foo"" << std::endl;    
    }

    void Foo() const
    {
        counter++;    // This works because counter is `mutable`
        std::cout << ""Foo const"" << std::endl;
    }

    int GetInvocations() const
    {
        return counter;
    }
};

int main(void)
{
    MyClass cc;
    const MyClass& ccc = cc;
    cc.Foo();
    ccc.Foo();
    std::cout << ""Foo has been invoked "" << ccc.GetInvocations() << "" times"" << std::endl;
}

which would output

That means the selector div > p.some_class only selects paragraphs of .some_class that are nested directly inside a div, and not any paragraphs that are nested further within.
An illustration:


div > p.some_class { 
    background: yellow;
}
<div>
    <p class=""some_class"">Some text here</p>     <!-- Selected [1] -->
    <blockquote>
        <p class=""some_class"">More text here</p> <!-- Not selected [2] -->
    </blockquote>
</div>



What's selected and what's not:

Selected
This p.some_class is located directly inside the div, hence a parent-child relationship is established between both elements.

Not selected
This p.some_class is contained by a blockquote within the div, rather than the div itself. Although this p.some_class is a descendant of the div, it's not a child; it's a grandchild.
Consequently, while div > p.some_class won't match this element, div p.some_class will, using the descendant combinator instead.



1 Many people go further to call it ""direct child"" or ""immediate child"", but that's completely unnecessary (and incredibly annoying to me), because a child element is immediate by definition anyway, so they mean the exact same thing. There's no such thing as an ""indirect child"".

> (greater-than sign) is a CSS Combinator.

A combinator is something that explains the relationship between the selectors.  

A CSS selector can contain more than one simple selector. Between the simple selectors, we can include a combinator.
There are four different combinators in CSS3:

descendant selector (space) 
child selector (>) 
adjacent sibling selector (+) 
general sibling selector (~)

Note: < is not valid in CSS selectors.  

For example: 
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
<style>
div > p {
    background-color: yellow;
}
</style>
</head>
<body>

<div>
  <p>Paragraph 1 in the div.</p>
  <p>Paragraph 2 in the div.</p>
  <span><p>Paragraph 3 in the div.</p></span> <!-- not Child but Descendant -->
</div>

<p>Paragraph 4. Not in a div.</p>
<p>Paragraph 5. Not in a div.</p>

</body>
</html>

For example, adding a bunch of strings,

What is the line?  You can just have arguments on the next line without any problems:
a = dostuff(blahblah1, blahblah2, blahblah3, blahblah4, blahblah5, 
            blahblah6, blahblah7)

Otherwise you can do something like this:
if a == True and \
   b == False

Check the style guide for more information.
From your example line:
a = '1' + '2' + '3' + \
    '4' + '5'

Or:
a = ('1' + '2' + '3' +
    '4' + '5')

Note that the style guide says that using the implicit continuation with parentheses is preferred, but in this particular case just adding parentheses around your expression is probably the wrong way to go.
",1264,"
From PEP 8 -- Style Guide for Python Code:

The preferred way of wrapping long lines is by using Python's implied line continuation inside parentheses, brackets and braces. Long lines can be broken over multiple lines by wrapping expressions in parentheses. These should be used in preference to using a backslash for line continuation.
Backslashes may still be appropriate at times. For example, long, multiple with-statements cannot use implicit continuation, so backslashes are acceptable:
with open('/path/to/some/file/you/want/to/read') as file_1, \
        open('/path/to/some/file/being/written', 'w') as file_2:
    file_2.write(file_1.read())

Another such case is with assert statements.
Make sure to indent the continued line appropriately. The preferred place to break around a binary operator is after the operator, not before it. Some examples:
class Rectangle(Blob):

    def __init__(self, width, height,
                 color='black', emphasis=None, highlight=0):
        if (width == 0 and height == 0 and
                color == 'red' and emphasis == 'strong' or
                highlight > 100):
            raise ValueError(""sorry, you lose"")
        if width == 0 and height == 0 and (color == 'red' or
                                           emphasis is None):
            raise ValueError(""I don't think so -- values are %s, %s"" %
                             (width, height))
        Blob.__init__(self, width, height,
                      color, emphasis, highlight)


PEP8 now recommends the opposite convention (for breaking at binary operations) used by mathematicians and their publishers to improve readability.
Donald Knuth's style of breaking before a binary operator aligns operators vertically, thus reducing the eye's workload when determining which items are added and subtracted.
From PEP8: Should a line break before or after a binary operator?:

Donald Knuth explains the traditional rule in his Computers and Typesetting series: ""Although formulas within a paragraph always break after binary operations and relations, displayed formulas always break before binary operations""[3].
Following the tradition from mathematics usually results in more readable code:

Whenever the Python interpreter reads a source file, it does two things:

it sets a few special variables like __name__, and then

it executes all of the code found in the file.


Let's see how this works and how it relates to your question about the __name__ checks we always see in Python scripts.
Code Sample
Let's use a slightly different code sample to explore how imports and scripts work.  Suppose the following is in a file called foo.py.
# Suppose this is foo.py.

print(""before import"")
import math

print(""before functionA"")
def functionA():
    print(""Function A"")

print(""before functionB"")
def functionB():
    print(""Function B {}"".format(math.sqrt(100)))

print(""before __name__ guard"")
if __name__ == '__main__':
    functionA()
    functionB()
print(""after __name__ guard"")

Special Variables
When the Python interpreter reads a source file, it first defines a few special variables. In this case, we care about the __name__ variable.
When Your Module Is the Main Program
If you are running your module (the source file) as the main program, e.g.
python foo.py

the interpreter will assign the hard-coded string ""__main__"" to the __name__ variable, i.e.
# It's as if the interpreter inserts this at the top
# of your module when run as the main program.
__name__ = ""__main__"" 

When Your Module Is Imported By Another
On the other hand, suppose some other module is the main program and it imports your module. This means there's a statement like this in the main program, or in some other module the main program imports:
# Suppose this is in some other main program.
import foo

The interpreter will search for your foo.py file (along with searching for a few other variants), and prior to executing that module, it will assign the name ""foo"" from the import statement to the __name__ variable, i.e.
# It's as if the interpreter inserts this at the top
# of your module when it's imported from another module.
__name__ = ""foo""

Executing the Module's Code
After the special variables are set up, the interpreter executes all the code in the module, one statement at a time. You may want to open another window on the side with the code sample so you can follow along with this explanation.
Always

It prints the string ""before import"" (without quotes).

It loads the math module and assigns it to a variable called math. This is equivalent to replacing import math with the following (note that __import__ is a low-level function in Python that takes a string and triggers the actual import):


# Find and load a module given its string name, ""math"",
# then assign it to a local variable called math.
math = __import__(""math"")


It prints the string ""before functionA"".

It executes the def block, creating a function object, then assigning that function object to a variable called functionA.

It prints the string ""before functionB"".

It executes the second def block, creating another function object, then assigning it to a variable called functionB.

It prints the string ""before __name__ guard"".


Only When Your Module Is the Main Program

If your module is the main program, then it will see that __name__ was indeed set to ""__main__"" and it calls the two functions, printing the strings ""Function A"" and ""Function B 10.0"".

Only When Your Module Is Imported by Another

(instead) If your module is not the main program but was imported by another one, then __name__ will be ""foo"", not ""__main__"", and it'll skip the body of the if statement.

Always

It will print the string ""after __name__ guard"" in both situations.

Summary
In summary, here's what'd be printed in the two cases:
# What gets printed if foo is the main program
before import
before functionA
before functionB
before __name__ guard
Function A
Function B 10.0
after __name__ guard

# What gets printed if foo is imported as a regular module
before import
before functionA
before functionB
before __name__ guard
after __name__ guard

Why Does It Work This Way?
You might naturally wonder why anybody would want this.  Well, sometimes you want to write a .py file that can be both used by other programs and/or modules as a module, and can also be run as the main program itself.  Examples:

Your module is a library, but you want to have a script mode where it runs some unit tests or a demo.

Your module is only used as a main program, but it has some unit tests, and the testing framework works by importing .py files like your script and running special test functions. You don't want it to try running the script just because it's importing the module.

Your module is mostly used as a main program, but it also provides a programmer-friendly API for advanced users.


Beyond those examples, it's elegant that running a script in Python is just setting up a few magic variables and importing the script. ""Running"" the script is a side effect of importing the script's module.
Food for Thought

Question: Can I have multiple __name__ checking blocks?  Answer: it's strange to do so, but the language won't stop you.

Suppose the following is in foo2.py.  What happens if you say python foo2.py on the command-line? Why?


# Suppose this is foo2.py.
import os, sys; sys.path.insert(0, os.path.dirname(__file__)) # needed for some interpreters

def functionA():
    print(""a1"")
    from foo2 import functionB
    print(""a2"")
    functionB()
    print(""a3"")

def functionB():
    print(""b"")

print(""t1"")
if __name__ == ""__main__"":
    print(""m1"")
    functionA()
    print(""m2"")
print(""t2"")
      


Now, figure out what will happen if you remove the __name__ check in foo3.py:

# Suppose this is foo3.py.
import os, sys; sys.path.insert(0, os.path.dirname(__file__)) # needed for some interpreters

def functionA():
    print(""a1"")
    from foo3 import functionB
    print(""a2"")
    functionB()
    print(""a3"")

def functionB():
    print(""b"")

print(""t1"")
print(""m1"")
functionA()
print(""m2"")
print(""t2"")


What will this do when used as a script?  When imported as a module?

# Suppose this is in foo4.py
__name__ = ""__main__""

def bar():
    print(""bar"")
    
print(""before __name__ guard"")
if __name__ == ""__main__"":
    bar()
print(""after __name__ guard"")

",7078,"
When your script is run by passing it as a command to the Python interpreter,
python myscript.py

all of the code that is at indentation level 0 gets executed.  Functions and classes that are defined are, well, defined, but none of their code gets run.  Unlike other languages, there's no main() function that gets run automatically - the main() function is implicitly all the code at the top level.
In this case, the top-level code is an if block.  __name__ is a built-in variable which evaluates to the name of the current module.  However, if a module is being run directly (as in myscript.py above), then __name__ instead is set to the string ""__main__"".  Thus, you can test whether your script is being run directly or being imported by something else by testing
if __name__ == ""__main__"":
    ...

If your script is being imported into another module, its various function and class definitions will be imported and its top-level code will be executed, but the code in the then-body of the if clause above won't get run as the condition is not met. As a basic example, consider the following two scripts:
# file one.py
def func():
    print(""func() in one.py"")

print(""top-level in one.py"")

if __name__ == ""__main__"":
    print(""one.py is being run directly"")
else:
    print(""one.py is being imported into another module"")

# file two.py
import one

print(""top-level in two.py"")
one.func()

if __name__ == ""__main__"":
    print(""two.py is being run directly"")
else:
    print(""two.py is being imported into another module"")

Now, if you invoke the interpreter as
python one.py

The output will be
top-level in one.py
one.py is being run directly

If you run two.py instead:
python two.py

You get
top-level in one.py
one.py is being imported into another module
top-level in two.py
func() in one.py
two.py is being run directly

Thus, when module one gets loaded, its __name__ equals ""one"" instead of ""__main__"".

I need to repeatedly remove the first line from a huge text file using a bash script.
Right now I am using sed -i -e ""1d"" $FILE - but it takes around a minute to do the deletion.
Is there a more efficient way to accomplish this?

Try tail:
tail -n +2 ""$FILE""

-n x: Just print the last x lines. tail -n 5 would give you the last 5 lines of the input. The + sign kind of inverts the argument and make tail print anything but the first x-1 lines. tail -n +1 would print the whole file, tail -n +2 everything but the first line, etc.
GNU tail is much faster than sed. tail is also available on BSD and the -n +2 flag is consistent across both tools. Check the FreeBSD or OS X man pages for more. 
The BSD version can be much slower than sed, though. I wonder how they managed that; tail should just read a file line by line while sed does pretty complex operations involving interpreting a script, applying regular expressions and the like.
Note: You may be tempted to use
# THIS WILL GIVE YOU AN EMPTY FILE!
tail -n +2 ""$FILE"" > ""$FILE""

but this will give you an empty file. The reason is that the redirection (>) happens before tail is invoked by the shell:

Shell truncates file $FILE
Shell creates a new process for tail
Shell redirects stdout of the tail process to $FILE
tail reads from the now empty $FILE

If you want to remove the first line inside the file, you should use:
tail -n +2 ""$FILE"" > ""$FILE.tmp"" && mv ""$FILE.tmp"" ""$FILE""

The && will make sure that the file doesn't get overwritten when there is a problem.

129,5971645,4055633,What does ~~ (“double tilde”) do in Javascript?,"
I was checking out an online game physics library today and came across the ~~ operator.  I know a single ~ is a bitwise NOT, would that make ~~ a NOT of a NOT, which would give back the same value, wouldn't it?
","22,516",213,52,javascript ,https://stackoverflow.com/questions/4055633/what-does-double-tilde-do-in-javascript,9,"
It removes everything after the decimal point because the bitwise operators implicitly convert their operands to signed 32-bit integers. This works whether the operands are (floating-point) numbers or strings, and the result is a number.
In other words, it yields:
function(x) {
  if(x < 0) return Math.ceil(x);
  else return Math.floor(x);
}

only if x is between -(231) and 231 - 1. Otherwise, overflow will occur and the number will ""wrap around"".
This may be considered useful to convert a function's string argument to a number, but both because of the possibility of overflow and that it is incorrect for use with non-integers, I would not use it that way except for ""code golf"" (i.e. pointlessly trimming bytes off the source code of your program at the expense of readability and robustness). I would use +x or Number(x) instead.

How this is the NOT of the NOT
The number -43.2, for example is:
-43.210 = 111111111111111111111111110101012
as a signed (two's complement) 32-bit binary number. (JavaScript ignores what is after the decimal point.) Inverting the bits gives:
NOT -4310 = 000000000000000000000000001010102 = 4210
Inverting again gives:
NOT 4210 = 111111111111111111111111110101012 = -4310
This differs from Math.floor(-43.2) in that negative numbers are rounded toward zero, not away from it. (The floor function, which would equal -44, always rounds down to the next lower integer, regardless of whether the number is positive or negative.)
",252,"
The first ~ operator forces the operand to an integer (possibly after coercing the value to a string or a boolean), then inverts the lowest 31 bits. Officially ECMAScript numbers are all floating-point, but some numbers are implemented as 31-bit integers in the SpiderMonkey engine.
You can use it to turn a 1-element array into an integer. Floating-points are converted according to the C rule, ie. truncation of the fractional part.
The second ~ operator then inverts the bits back, so you know that you will have an integer. This is not the same as coercing a value to boolean in a condition statement, because an empty object {} evaluates to true, whereas ~~{} evaluates to false.

You can change the working directory with:
import os

os.chdir(path)

There are two best practices to follow when using this method:

Catch the exception (WindowsError, OSError) on invalid path.  If the exception is thrown, do not perform any recursive operations, especially destructive ones.  They will operate on the old path and not the new one.
Return to your old directory when you're done.  This can be done in an exception-safe manner by wrapping your chdir call in a context manager, like Brian M. Hunt did in his answer.

Changing the current working directory in a subprocess does not change the current working directory in the parent process.  This is true of the Python interpreter as well.  You cannot use os.chdir() to change the CWD of the calling process.
",815,"
Here's an example of a context manager to change the working directory. It is simpler than an ActiveState version referred to elsewhere, but this gets the job done.
Context Manager: cd

        os.chdir(self.newPath)

    def __exit__(self, etype, value, traceback):
        os.chdir(self.savedPath)

Or try the more concise equivalent(below), using ContextManager.
Example
import subprocess # just to call an arbitrary command e.g. 'ls'

# enter the directory like this:

I have a bit of code where I am looping through all the select boxes on a page and binding a .hover event to them to do a bit of twiddling with their width on mouse on/off.
This happens on page ready and works just fine.
The problem I have is that any select boxes I add via Ajax or DOM after the initial loop won't have the event bound.
I have found this plugin (jQuery Live Query Plugin), but before I add another 5k to my pages with a plugin, I want to see if anyone knows a way to do this, either with jQuery directly or by another option.
","882,740",1677,513,javascript jquery events unobtrusive-javascript ,https://stackoverflow.com/questions/203198/event-binding-on-dynamically-created-elements,23,"
As of jQuery 1.7 you should use jQuery.fn.on with the selector parameter filled:
$(staticAncestors).on(eventName, dynamicChild, function() {});

Explanation:
This is called event delegation and works as followed. The event is attached to a static parent (staticAncestors) of the element that should be handled. This jQuery handler is triggered every time the event triggers on this element or one of the descendant elements. The handler then checks if the element that triggered the event matches your selector (dynamicChild). When there is a match then your custom handler function is executed.

Prior to this, the recommended approach was to use live():
$(selector).live( eventName, function(){} );

However, live() was deprecated in 1.7 in favour of on(), and completely removed in 1.9. The live() signature:
$(selector).live( eventName, function(){} );

... can be replaced with the following on() signature:
$(document).on( eventName, selector, function(){} );


For example, if your page was dynamically creating elements with the class name dosomething you would bind the event to a parent which already exists (this is the nub of the problem here, you need something that exists to bind to, don't bind to the dynamic content), this can be (and the easiest option) is document. Though bear in mind document may not be the most efficient option.
$(document).on('mouseover mouseout', '.dosomething', function(){
    // what you want to happen when mouseover and mouseout 
    // occurs on elements that match '.dosomething'
});

Any parent that exists at the time the event is bound is fine. For example
$('.buttons').on('click', 'button', function(){
    // do something here
});

would apply to
<div class=""buttons"">
    <!-- <button>s that are generated dynamically and added here -->
</div>

",2323,"
There is a good explanation in the documentation of jQuery.fn.on.
In short:

Event handlers are bound only to the currently selected elements; they must exist on the page at the time your code makes the call to .on().

Thus in the following example #dataTable tbody tr must exist before the code is generated.
$(""#dataTable tbody tr"").on(""click"", function(event){
    console.log($(this).text());
});

If new HTML is being injected into the page, it is preferable to use delegated events to attach an event handler, as described next.
Delegated events have the advantage that they can process events from descendant elements that are added to the document at a later time. For example, if the table exists, but the rows are added dynamically using code, the following will handle it:
$(""#dataTable tbody"").on(""click"", ""tr"", function(event){
    console.log($(this).text());
});

In addition to their ability to handle events on descendant elements which are not yet created, another advantage of delegated events is their potential for much lower overhead when many elements must be monitored. On a data table with 1,000 rows in its tbody, the first code example attaches a handler to 1,000 elements.
A delegated-events approach (the second code example) attaches an event handler to only one element, the tbody, and the event only needs to bubble up one level (from the clicked tr to tbody).
Note: Delegated events do not work for SVG.

You could use any class that implements IInterface? When would you need to do that? The only thing I can think of is if you have a method and you are unsure of what object will be passed except for it implementing IInterface. I cannot think how often you would need to do that. 
Also, how could you write a method that takes in an object that implements an interface? Is that possible?

There are some wonderful answers on here to this questions that get into all sorts of great detail about interfaces and loosely coupling code, inversion of control and so on.  There are some fairly heady discussions, so I'd like to take the opportunity to break things down a bit for understanding why an interface is useful.
When I first started getting exposed to interfaces, I too was confused about their relevance.  I didn't understand why you needed them.  If we're using a language like Java or C#, we already have inheritance and I viewed interfaces as a weaker form of inheritance and thought, ""why bother?""  In a sense I was right, you can think of interfaces as sort of a weak form of inheritance, but beyond that I finally understood their use as a language construct by thinking of them as a means of classifying common traits or behaviors that were exhibited by potentially many non-related classes of objects.
For example -- say you have a SIM game and have the following classes:
class HouseFly inherits Insect {
    void FlyAroundYourHead(){}
    void LandOnThings(){}
}

class Telemarketer inherits Person {
    void CallDuringDinner(){}
    void ContinueTalkingWhenYouSayNo(){}
}

Clearly, these two objects have nothing in common in terms of direct inheritance.  But, you could say they are both annoying.  
Let's say our game needs to have some sort of random thing that annoys the game player when they eat dinner.  This could be a HouseFly or a Telemarketer or both -- but how do you allow for both with a single function?  And how do you ask each different type of object to ""do their annoying thing"" in the same way?
The key to realize is that both a Telemarketer and HouseFly share a common loosely interpreted behavior even though they are nothing alike in terms of modeling them.  So, let's make an interface that both can implement:
interface IPest {
    void BeAnnoying();
}

class HouseFly inherits Insect implements IPest {
    void FlyAroundYourHead(){}
    void LandOnThings(){}

    void BeAnnoying() {
        FlyAroundYourHead();
        LandOnThings();
    }
}

class Telemarketer inherits Person implements IPest {
    void CallDuringDinner(){}
    void ContinueTalkingWhenYouSayNo(){}

    void BeAnnoying() {
        CallDuringDinner();
        ContinueTalkingWhenYouSayNo();
    }
}

We now have two classes that can each be annoying in their own way.  And they do not need to derive from the same base class and share common inherent characteristics -- they simply need to satisfy the contract of IPest -- that contract is simple.  You just have to BeAnnoying.  In this regard, we can model the following:
class DiningRoom {

    DiningRoom(Person[] diningPeople, IPest[] pests) { ... }

    void ServeDinner() {
        when diningPeople are eating,

        foreach pest in pests
        pest.BeAnnoying();
    }
}

Here we have a dining room that accepts a number of diners and a number of pests -- note the use of the interface.  This means that in our little world, a member of the pests array could actually be a Telemarketer object or a HouseFly object.
The ServeDinner method is called when dinner is served and our people in the dining room are supposed to eat.  In our little game, that's when our pests do their work -- each pest is instructed to be annoying by way of the IPest interface.  In this way, we can easily have both Telemarketers and HouseFlys be annoying in each of their own ways -- we care only that we have something in the DiningRoom object that is a pest, we don't really care what it is and they could have nothing in common with other.  
This very contrived pseudo-code example (that dragged on a lot longer than I anticipated) is simply meant to illustrate the kind of thing that finally turned the light on for me in terms of when we might use an interface.  I apologize in advance for the silliness of the example, but hope that it helps in your understanding.  And, to be sure, the other posted answers you've received here really cover the gamut of the use of interfaces today in design patterns and development methodologies.  
",1670,"
The specific example I used to give to students is that they should write
List myList = new ArrayList(); // programming to the List interface

instead of
ArrayList myList = new ArrayList(); // this is bad

These look exactly the same in a short program, but if you go on to use myList 100 times in your program you can start to see a difference.  The first declaration ensures that you only call methods on myList that are defined by the List interface (so no ArrayList specific methods).  If you've programmed to the interface this way, later on you can decide that you really need
List myList = new TreeList();

and you only have to change your code in that one spot.  You already know that the rest of your code doesn't do anything that will be broken by changing the implementation because you programmed to the interface.
The benefits are even more obvious (I think) when you're talking about method parameters and return values.  Take this for example:
public ArrayList doSomething(HashMap map);

That method declaration ties you to two concrete implementations (ArrayList and HashMap). As soon as that method is called from other code, any changes to those types probably mean you're going to have to change the calling code as well. It would be better to program to the interfaces.
public List doSomething(Map map);

Now it doesn't matter what kind of List you return, or what kind of Map is passed in as a parameter. Changes that you make inside the doSomething method won't force you to change the calling code.

is is identity testing, == is equality testing. what happens in your code would be emulated in the interpreter like this:
>>> a = 'pub'
>>> b = ''.join(['p', 'u', 'b'])
>>> a == b
True
>>> a is b
False

so, no wonder they're not the same, right?
In other words: is is the id(a) == id(b)
",1559,"
Other answers here are correct: is is used for identity comparison, while == is used for equality comparison. Since what you care about is equality (the two strings should contain the same characters), in this case the is operator is simply wrong and you should be using == instead.
The reason is works interactively is that (most) string literals are interned by default. From Wikipedia:

Interned strings speed up string
  comparisons, which are sometimes a
  performance bottleneck in applications
  (such as compilers and dynamic
  programming language runtimes) that
  rely heavily on hash tables with
  string keys. Without interning,
  checking that two different strings
  are equal involves examining every
  character of both strings. This is
  slow for several reasons: it is
  inherently O(n) in the length of the
  strings; it typically requires reads
  from several regions of memory, which
  take time; and the reads fills up the
  processor cache, meaning there is less
  cache available for other needs. With
  interned strings, a simple object
  identity test suffices after the
  original intern operation; this is
  typically implemented as a pointer
  equality test, normally just a single
  machine instruction with no memory
  reference at all.

So, when you have two string literals (words that are literally typed into your program source code, surrounded by quotation marks) in your program that have the same value, the Python compiler will automatically intern the strings, making them both stored at the same memory location.  (Note that this doesn't always happen, and the rules for when this happens are quite convoluted, so please don't rely on this behavior in production code!)
Since in your interactive session both strings are actually stored in the same memory location, they have the same identity, so the is operator works as expected.  But if you construct a string by some other method (even if that string contains exactly the same characters), then the string may be equal, but it is not the same string -- that is, it has a different identity, because it is stored in a different place in memory.

Note to readers!
As commenters have pointed out, this solution is ""clever"", and as
  clever solutions often are, it's memory intensive and relatively
  slow. If performance is a concern for you, don't use this solution!
Potentially outdated: ECMAScript 2017 includes String.prototype.padStart and Number.prototype.toLocaleString is there since ECMAScript 3.1. Example:
var n=-0.1;
n.toLocaleString('en', {minimumIntegerDigits:4,minimumFractionDigits:2,useGrouping:false})

...will output ""-0000.10"".
// or 
const padded = (.1+"""").padStart(6,""0"");
`-${padded}`

...will output ""-0000.1"".

  {
    return new Array( width + (/\./.test( number ) ? 2 : 1) ).join( '0' ) + number;
  }
  return number + """"; // always return a string

you could bake this into a library if you want to conserve namespace or whatever.  Like with jQuery's extend.

Simple way. You could add string multiplication for the pad and turn it into a function.
var pad = ""000000"";
var n = '5';
var result = (pad+n).slice(-pad.length);

As a function,
function paddy(num, padlen, padchar) {
    var pad_char = typeof padchar !== 'undefined' ? padchar : '0';
    var pad = new Array(1 + padlen).join(pad_char);

The following CSS rule disables resizing behavior for textarea elements:
textarea {
  resize: none;
}

To disable it for some (but not all) textareas, there are a couple of options.
To disable a specific textarea with the name attribute set to foo (i.e., <textarea name=""foo""></textarea>):
textarea[name=foo] {
  resize: none;
}

Or, using an id attribute (i.e., <textarea id=""foo""></textarea>):
#foo {
  resize: none;
}

The W3C page lists possible values for resizing restrictions: none, both, horizontal, vertical, and inherit:
textarea {
  resize: vertical; /* user can resize vertically, but width is fixed */
}

Review a decent compatibility page to see what browsers currently support this feature. As Jon Hulka has commented, the dimensions can be further restrained in CSS using max-width, max-height, min-width, and min-height.

Super important to know:
This property does nothing unless the overflow property is something other than visible, which is the default for most elements. So generally to use this, you'll have to set something like overflow: scroll;

Approach 1 - transform translateX/translateY:
Example Here / Full Screen Example
In supported browsers (most of them), you can use top: 50%/left: 50% in combination with  translateX(-50%) translateY(-50%) to dynamically vertically/horizontally center the element.



.container {
    position: absolute;
    top: 50%;
    left: 50%;
    -moz-transform: translateX(-50%) translateY(-50%);
    -webkit-transform: translateX(-50%) translateY(-50%);
    transform: translateX(-50%) translateY(-50%);
}
<div class=""container"">
    <span>I'm vertically/horizontally centered!</span>
</div>





Approach 2 - Flexbox method:
Example Here / Full Screen Example
In supported browsers, set the display of the targeted element to flex and use align-items: center for vertical centering and justify-content: center for horizontal centering. Just don't forget to add vendor prefixes for additional browser support (see example).



html, body, .container {
    height: 100%;
}

.container {
    display: -webkit-flexbox;
    display: -ms-flexbox;
    display: -webkit-flex;
    display: flex;
    -webkit-flex-align: center;
    -ms-flex-align: center;
    -webkit-align-items: center;
    align-items: center;
    justify-content: center;
}
<div class=""container""> 
  <span>I'm vertically/horizontally centered!</span>
</div>





Approach 3 - table-cell/vertical-align: middle:
Example Here / Full Screen Example
In some cases, you will need to ensure that the html/body element's height is set to 100%.
For vertical alignment, set the parent element's width/height to 100% and add display: table. Then for the child element, change the display to table-cell and add vertical-align: middle.
For horizontal centering, you could either add text-align: center to center the text and any other inline children elements. Alternatively, you could use margin: 0 auto, assuming the element is block level.



html, body {
    height: 100%;
}
.parent {
    width: 100%;
    height: 100%;
    display: table;
    text-align: center;
}
.parent > .child {
    display: table-cell;
    vertical-align: middle;
}
<section class=""parent"">
    <div class=""child"">I'm vertically/horizontally centered!</div>
</section>





Approach 4 - Absolutely positioned 50% from the top with displacement:
Example Here / Full Screen Example
This approach assumes that the text has a known height - in this instance, 18px. Just absolutely position the element 50% from the top, relative to the parent element. Use a negative margin-top value that is half of the element's known height, in this case - -9px.



html, body, .container {
    height: 100%;
}

.container {
    position: relative;
    text-align: center;
}

.container > p {
    position: absolute;
    top: 50%;
    left: 0;
    right: 0;
    margin-top: -9px;
}
<div class=""container"">
    <p>I'm vertically/horizontally centered!</p>
</div>





Approach 5 - The line-height method (Least flexible - not suggested):
Example Here
In some cases, the parent element will have a fixed height. For vertical centering, all you have to do is set a line-height value on the child element equal to the fixed height of the parent element.
Though this solution will work in some cases, it's worth noting that it won't work when there are multiple lines of text - like this.



.parent {
    height: 200px;
    width: 400px;
    background: lightgray;
    text-align: center;
}

.parent > .child {
    line-height: 200px;
}
<div class=""parent"">
    <span class=""child"">I'm vertically/horizontally centered!</span>
</div>



",699,"
If CSS3 is an option (or you have a fallback) you can use transform:
.center {
    right: 50%;
    bottom: 50%;
    transform: translate(50%,50%);
    position: absolute;
}

Unlike the first approach above, you don't want to use left:50% with the negative translation because there's an overflow bug in IE9+. Utilize a positive right value and you won't see horizontal scrollbars.

Use unshift. It's like push, except it adds elements to the beginning of the array instead of the end.

unshift/push - add an element to the beginning/end of an array
shift/pop  - remove and return the first/last element of an array

A simple diagram...
   unshift -> array <- push
   shift   <- array -> pop
 

and chart:
          add  remove  start  end
   push    X                   X
    pop           X            X
unshift    X             X
  shift           X      X

Check out the MDN Array documentation. Virtually every language that has the ability to push/pop elements from an array will also have the ability to unshift/shift (sometimes called push_front/pop_front) elements, you should never have to implement these yourself.

As pointed out in the comments, if you want to avoid mutating your original array, you can use concat, which concatenates two or more arrays together. You can use this to functionally push a single element onto the front or back of an existing array; to do so, you need to turn the new element into a single element array:


const array = [3, 2, 1]

const newFirstElement = 4

const newArray = [newFirstElement].concat(array) // [ 4, 3, 2, 1 ]

console.log(newArray);



concat can also append items. The arguments to concat can be of any type; they are implicitly wrapped in a single-element array, if they are not already an array:


const array = [3, 2, 1]

const newLastElement = 0

// Both of these lines are equivalent:
const newArray1 = array.concat(newLastElement) // [ 3, 2, 1, 0 ]
const newArray2 = array.concat([newLastElement]) // [ 3, 2, 1, 0 ]

console.log(newArray1);

Just for completeness as nobody else has mentioned it.  The third parameter to an array slice is a step.  So reversing a string is as simple as:

Or selecting alternate characters would be:

Yes, contains is case sensitive.  You can use java.util.regex.Pattern with the CASE_INSENSITIVE flag for case insensitive matching:
Pattern.compile(Pattern.quote(wantedStr), Pattern.CASE_INSENSITIVE).matcher(source).find();

I've been using the == operator in my program to compare all my strings so far.
However, I ran into a bug, changed one of them into .equals() instead, and it fixed the bug.
Is == bad? When should it and should it not be used? What's the difference?
","3,977,068",724,1000,java string equality ,https://stackoverflow.com/questions/513832/how-do-i-compare-strings-in-java,23,"
== tests for reference equality (whether they are the same object).
.equals() tests for value equality (whether they are logically ""equal""). 
Objects.equals() checks for null before calling .equals() so you don't have to (available as of JDK7, also available in Guava).
Consequently, if you want to test whether two strings have the same value you will probably want to use Objects.equals().
// These two have the same value
new String(""test"").equals(""test"") // --> true 

// ... but they are not the same object
new String(""test"") == ""test"" // --> false 

// ... neither are these
new String(""test"") == new String(""test"") // --> false 

// ... but these are because literals are interned by 
// the compiler and thus refer to the same object
""test"" == ""test"" // --> true 

// ... string literals are concatenated by the compiler
// and the results are interned.
""test"" == ""te"" + ""st"" // --> true

// ... but you should really just call Objects.equals()
Objects.equals(""test"", new String(""test"")) // --> true
Objects.equals(null, ""test"") // --> false
Objects.equals(null, null) // --> true

You almost always want to use Objects.equals(). In the rare situation where you know you're dealing with interned strings, you can use ==.
From JLS 3.10.5. String Literals:

Moreover, a string literal always refers to the same instance of class String. This is because string literals - or, more generally, strings that are the values of constant expressions (§15.28) - are ""interned"" so as to share unique instances, using the method String.intern.

Similar examples can also be found in JLS 3.10.5-1.
Other Methods To Consider
String.equalsIgnoreCase() value equality that ignores case.
String.contentEquals() compares the content of the String with the content of any CharSequence (available since Java 1.5). Saves you from having to turn your StringBuffer, etc into a String before doing the equality comparison, but leaves the null checking to you.
",5638,"
== tests object references, .equals() tests the string values.  
Sometimes it looks as if == compares values, because Java does some behind-the-scenes stuff to make sure identical in-line strings are actually the same object.
For example:  
String fooString1 = new String(""foo"");
String fooString2 = new String(""foo"");

// Evaluates to false
fooString1 == fooString2;

// Evaluates to true
fooString1.equals(fooString2);

// Evaluates to true, because Java uses the same object
""bar"" == ""bar"";

But beware of nulls! 
== handles null strings fine, but calling .equals() from a null string will cause an exception:  
String nullString1 = null;
String nullString2 = null;

// Evaluates to true
System.out.print(nullString1 == nullString2);

// Throws a NullPointerException
System.out.print(nullString1.equals(nullString2));

So if you know that fooString1 may be null, tell the reader that by writing
System.out.print(fooString1 != null && fooString1.equals(""bar""));

The following are shorter, but it’s less obvious that it checks for null:
System.out.print(""bar"".equals(fooString1));  // ""bar"" is never null
System.out.print(Objects.equals(fooString1, ""bar""));  // Java 7 required

","4,266,138",4829,1475,javascript arrays loops foreach iteration ,https://stackoverflow.com/questions/9329446/for-each-over-an-array-in-javascript,40,"
TL;DR

Don't use for-in unless you use it with safeguards or are at least aware of why it might bite you.
Your best bets are usually

a for-of loop (ES2015+ only),
Array#forEach (spec | MDN) (or its relatives some and such) (ES5+ only),
a simple old-fashioned for loop,
or for-in with safeguards.


But there's lots more to explore, read on...

JavaScript has powerful semantics for looping through arrays and array-like objects. I've split the answer into two parts: Options for genuine arrays, and options for things that are just array-like, such as the arguments object, other iterable objects (ES2015+), DOM collections, and so on.
I'll quickly note that you can use the ES2015 options now, even on ES5 engines, by transpiling ES2015 to ES5. Search for ""ES2015 transpiling"" / ""ES6 transpiling"" for more...
Okay, let's look at our options:
For Actual Arrays
You have three options in ECMAScript 5 (""ES5""), the version most broadly supported at the moment, and two more added in ECMAScript 2015 (""ES2015"", ""ES6""):

Use forEach and related (ES5+)
Use a simple for loop
Use for-in correctly
Use for-of (use an iterator implicitly) (ES2015+)
Use an iterator explicitly (ES2015+)

Details:
1. Use forEach and related
In any vaguely-modern environment (so, not IE8) where you have access to the Array features added by ES5 (directly or using polyfills), you can use forEach (spec | MDN):


var a = [""a"", ""b"", ""c""];
a.forEach(function(entry) {
    console.log(entry);
});



forEach accepts a callback function and, optionally, a value to use as this when calling that callback (not used above). The callback is called for each entry in the array, in order, skipping non-existent entries in sparse arrays. Although I only used one argument above, the callback is called with three: The value of each entry, the index of that entry, and a reference to the array you're iterating over (in case your function doesn't already have it handy).
Unless you're supporting obsolete browsers like IE8 (which NetApps shows at just over 4% market share as of this writing in September 2016), you can happily use forEach in a general-purpose web page without a shim. If you do need to support obsolete browsers, shimming/polyfilling forEach is easily done (search for ""es5 shim"" for several options).
forEach has the benefit that you don't have to declare indexing and value variables in the containing scope, as they're supplied as arguments to the iteration function, and so nicely scoped to just that iteration.
If you're worried about the runtime cost of making a function call for each array entry, don't be; details.
Additionally, forEach is the ""loop through them all"" function, but ES5 defined several other useful ""work your way through the array and do things"" functions, including:

every (stops looping the first time the callback returns false or something falsey)
some (stops looping the first time the callback returns true or something truthy)
filter (creates a new array including elements where the filter function returns true and omitting the ones where it returns false)
map (creates a new array from the values returned by the callback)
reduce (builds up a value by repeatedly calling the callback, passing in previous values; see the spec for the details; useful for summing the contents of an array and many other things)
reduceRight (like reduce, but works in descending rather than ascending order)

2. Use a simple for loop
Sometimes the old ways are the best:


var index;
var a = [""a"", ""b"", ""c""];
for (index = 0; index < a.length; ++index) {
    console.log(a[index]);
}



If the length of the array won't change during the loop, and it's in performance-sensitive code (unlikely), a slightly more complicated version grabbing the length up front might be a tiny bit faster:


var index, len;
var a = [""a"", ""b"", ""c""];
for (index = 0, len = a.length; index < len; ++index) {
    console.log(a[index]);
}



And/or counting backward:


var index;
var a = [""a"", ""b"", ""c""];
for (index = a.length - 1; index >= 0; --index) {
    console.log(a[index]);
}



But with modern JavaScript engines, it's rare you need to eke out that last bit of juice.
In ES2015 and higher, you can make your index and value variables local to the for loop:
let a = [""a"", ""b"", ""c""];
for (let index = 0; index < a.length; ++index) {
    let value = a[index];
    console.log(index, value);
}
//console.log(index);   // would cause ""ReferenceError: index is not defined""
//console.log(value);   // would cause ""ReferenceError: value is not defined""



let a = [""a"", ""b"", ""c""];
for (let index = 0; index < a.length; ++index) {
    let value = a[index];
    console.log(index, value);
}
try {
    console.log(index);
} catch (e) {
    console.error(e);   // ""ReferenceError: index is not defined""
}
try {
    console.log(value);
} catch (e) {
    console.error(e);   // ""ReferenceError: value is not defined""
}



And when you do that, not just value but also index is recreated for each loop iteration, meaning closures created in the loop body keep a reference to the index (and value) created for that specific iteration:
let divs = document.querySelectorAll(""div"");
for (let index = 0; index < divs.length; ++index) {
    divs[index].addEventListener('click', e => {
        console.log(""Index is: "" + index);
    });
}



let divs = document.querySelectorAll(""div"");
for (let index = 0; index < divs.length; ++index) {
    divs[index].addEventListener('click', e => {
        console.log(""Index is: "" + index);
    });
}
<div>zero</div>
<div>one</div>
<div>two</div>
<div>three</div>
<div>four</div>



If you had five divs, you'd get ""Index is: 0"" if you clicked the first and ""Index is: 4"" if you clicked the last. This does not work if you use var instead of let.
3. Use for-in correctly
You'll get people telling you to use for-in, but that's not what for-in is for. for-in loops through the enumerable properties of an object, not the indexes of an array. The order is not guaranteed, not even in ES2015 (ES6). ES2015+ does define an order to object properties (via [[OwnPropertyKeys]], [[Enumerate]], and things that use them like Object.getOwnPropertyKeys), but it didn't define that for-in would follow that order; ES2020 did, though. (Details in this other answer.)
The only real use cases for for-in on an array are:

It's a sparse arrays with massive gaps in it, or
You're using non-element properties and you want to include them in the loop

Looking only at that first example: You can use for-in to visit those sparse array elements if you use appropriate safeguards:


// `a` is a sparse array
var key;
var a = [];
a[0] = ""a"";
a[10] = ""b"";
a[10000] = ""c"";
for (key in a) {
    if (a.hasOwnProperty(key)  &&        // These checks are
        /^0$|^[1-9]\d*$/.test(key) &&    // explained
        key <= 4294967294                // below
        ) {
        console.log(a[key]);
    }
}



Note the three checks:

That the object has its own property by that name (not one it inherits from its prototype), and
That the key is all decimal digits (e.g., normal string form, not scientific notation), and
That the key's value when coerced to a number is <= 2^32 - 2 (which is 4,294,967,294). Where does that number come from? It's part of the definition of an array index in the specification. Other numbers (non-integers, negative numbers, numbers greater than 2^32 - 2) are not array indexes. The reason it's 2^32 - 2 is that that makes the greatest index value one lower than 2^32 - 1, which is the maximum value an array's length can have. (E.g., an array's length fits in a 32-bit unsigned integer.) (Props to RobG for pointing out in a comment on my blog post that my previous test wasn't quite right.)

You wouldn't do that in inline code, of course. You'd write a utility function. Perhaps:


// Utility function for antiquated environments without `forEach`
var hasOwn = Object.prototype.hasOwnProperty;
var rexNum = /^0$|^[1-9]\d*$/;
function sparseEach(array, callback, thisArg) {
    var index;
    for (var key in array) {
        index = +key;
        if (hasOwn.call(a, key) &&
            rexNum.test(key) &&
            index <= 4294967294
            ) {
            callback.call(thisArg, array[key], index, array);
        }
    }
}

var a = [];
a[5] = ""five"";
a[10] = ""ten"";
a[100000] = ""one hundred thousand"";
a.b = ""bee"";

sparseEach(a, function(value, index) {
    console.log(""Value at "" + index + "" is "" + value);
});



4. Use for-of (use an iterator implicitly) (ES2015+)
ES2015 added iterators to JavaScript. The easiest way to use iterators is the new for-of statement. It looks like this:


const a = [""a"", ""b"", ""c""];
for (const val of a) {
    console.log(val);
}



Under the covers, that gets an iterator from the array and loops through it, getting the values from it. This doesn't have the issue that using for-in has, because it uses an iterator defined by the object (the array), and arrays define that their iterators iterate through their entries (not their properties). Unlike for-in in ES5, the order in which the entries are visited is the numeric order of their indexes.
5. Use an iterator explicitly (ES2015+)
Sometimes, you might want to use an iterator explicitly. You can do that, too, although it's a lot clunkier than for-of. It looks like this:


const a = [""a"", ""b"", ""c""];
const it = a.values();
let entry;
while (!(entry = it.next()).done) {
    console.log(entry.value);
}



The iterator is an object matching the Iterator definition in the specification. Its next method returns a new result object each time you call it. The result object has a property, done, telling us whether it's done, and a property value with the value for that iteration. (done is optional if it would be false, value is optional if it would be undefined.)
The meaning of value varies depending on the iterator; arrays support (at least) three functions that return iterators:

values(): This is the one I used above. It returns an iterator where each value is the array entry for that iteration (""a"", ""b"", and ""c"" in the example earlier).
keys(): Returns an iterator where each value is the key for that iteration (so for our a above, that would be ""0"", then ""1"", then ""2"").
entries(): Returns an iterator where each value is an array in the form [key, value] for that iteration.

For Array-Like Objects
Aside from true arrays, there are also array-like objects that have a length property and properties with numeric names: NodeList instances, the arguments object, etc. How do we loop through their contents?
Use any of the options above for arrays
At least some, and possibly most or even all, of the array approaches above frequently apply equally well to array-like objects:

Use forEach and related (ES5+)
The various functions on Array.prototype are ""intentionally generic"" and can usually be used on array-like objects via Function#call or Function#apply. (See the Caveat for host-provided objects at the end of this answer, but it's a rare issue.)
Suppose you wanted to use forEach on a Node's childNodes property. You'd do this:
Array.prototype.forEach.call(node.childNodes, function(child) {
    // Do something with `child`
});

If you're going to do that a lot, you might want to grab a copy of the function reference into a variable for reuse, e.g.:
// (This is all presumably in some scoping function)
var forEach = Array.prototype.forEach;

// Then later...
forEach.call(node.childNodes, function(child) {
    // Do something with `child`
});

Use a simple for loop
Obviously, a simple for loop applies to array-like objects.
Use for-in correctly
for-in with the same safeguards as with an array should work with array-like objects as well; the caveat for host-provided objects on #1 above may apply.
Use for-of (use an iterator implicitly) (ES2015+)
for-of uses the iterator provided by the object (if any). That includes host-provided objects. For instance, the specification for the NodeList from querySelectorAll was updated to support iteration. The spec for the HTMLCollection from getElementsByTagName was not.
Use an iterator explicitly (ES2015+)
See #4.

Create a true array
Other times, you may want to convert an array-like object into a true array. Doing that is surprisingly easy:

Use the slice method of arrays
We can use the slice method of arrays, which like the other methods mentioned above is ""intentionally generic"" and so can be used with array-like objects, like this:
var trueArray = Array.prototype.slice.call(arrayLikeObject);

So for instance, if we want to convert a NodeList into a true array, we could do this:
var divs = Array.prototype.slice.call(document.querySelectorAll(""div""));

See the Caveat for host-provided objects below. In particular, note that this will fail in IE8 and earlier, which don't let you use host-provided objects as this like that.
Use spread syntax (...)
It's also possible to use ES2015's spread syntax with JavaScript engines that support this feature. Like for-of, this uses the iterator provided by the object (see #4 in the previous section):
var trueArray = [...iterableObject];

So for instance, if we want to convert a NodeList into a true array, with spread syntax this becomes quite succinct:
var divs = [...document.querySelectorAll(""div"")];

Use Array.from
Array.from (spec) | (MDN) (ES2015+, but easily polyfilled) creates an array from an array-like object, optionally passing the entries through a mapping function first. So:
var divs = Array.from(document.querySelectorAll(""div""));

Or if you wanted to get an array of the tag names of the elements with a given class, you'd use the mapping function:
// Arrow function (ES2015):
var divs = Array.from(document.querySelectorAll("".some-class""), element => element.tagName);

// Standard function (since `Array.from` can be shimmed):
var divs = Array.from(document.querySelectorAll("".some-class""), function(element) {
    return element.tagName;
});


Caveat for host-provided objects
If you use Array.prototype functions with host-provided array-like objects (DOM lists and other things provided by the browser rather than the JavaScript engine), you need to be sure to test in your target environments to make sure the host-provided object behaves properly. Most do behave properly (now), but it's important to test. The reason is that most of the Array.prototype methods you're likely to want to use rely on the host-provided object giving an honest answer to the abstract [[HasProperty]] operation. As of this writing, browsers do a very good job of this, but the 5.1 spec did allow for the possibility a host-provided object may not be honest. It's in §8.6.2, several paragraphs below the big table near the beginning of that section), where it says:

Host objects may implement these internal methods in any manner unless specified otherwise; for example, one possibility is that [[Get]] and [[Put]] for a particular host object indeed fetch and store property values but [[HasProperty]] always generates false.

(I couldn't find the equivalent verbiage in the ES2015 spec, but it's bound to still be the case.) Again, as of this writing the common host-provided array-like objects in modern browsers [NodeList instances, for instance] do handle [[HasProperty]] correctly, but it's important to test.)
",7212,"
Note: This answer is hopelessly out-of-date. For a more modern approach, look at the methods available on an array. Methods of interest might be:

forEach
map
filter
zip
reduce
every
some


The standard way to iterate an array in JavaScript is a vanilla for-loop:
var length = arr.length,
    element = null;
for (var i = 0; i < length; i++) {
  element = arr[i];
  // Do something with element
}

Note, however, that this approach is only good if you have a dense array, and each index is occupied by an element. If the array is sparse, then you can run into performance problems with this approach, since you will iterate over a lot of indices that do not really exist in the array. In this case, a for .. in-loop might be a better idea. However, you must use the appropriate safeguards to ensure that only the desired properties of the array (that is, the array elements) are acted upon, since the for..in-loop will also be enumerated in legacy browsers, or if the additional properties are defined as enumerable.
In ECMAScript 5 there will be a forEach method on the array prototype, but it is not supported in legacy browsers. So to be able to use it consistently you must either have an environment that supports it (for example, Node.js for server side JavaScript), or use a ""Polyfill"". The Polyfill for this functionality is, however, trivial and since it makes the code easier to read, it is a good polyfill to include.

I came across the Python with statement for the first time today.  I've been using Python lightly for several months and didn't even know of its existence!  Given its somewhat obscure status, I thought it would be worth asking:

What is the Python with statement
designed to be used for?   
What do
you use it for? 
Are there any
gotchas I need to be aware of, or
common anti-patterns associated with
its use?  Any cases where it is better use try..finally than with?
Why isn't it used more widely?
Which standard library classes are compatible with it?

","98,132",431,205,python language-features with-statement ,https://stackoverflow.com/questions/3012488/what-is-the-python-with-statement-designed-for,10,"

I believe this has already been answered by other users before me, so I only add it for the sake of completeness: the with statement simplifies exception handling by encapsulating common preparation and cleanup tasks in so-called context managers. More details can be found in PEP 343. For instance, the open statement is a context manager in itself, which lets you open a file, keep it open as long as the execution is in the context of the with statement where you used it, and close it as soon as you leave the context, no matter whether you have left it because of an exception or during regular control flow. The with statement can thus be used in ways similar to the RAII pattern in C++: some resource is acquired by the with statement and released when you leave the with context.
Some examples are: opening files using with open(filename) as fp:, acquiring locks using with lock: (where lock is an instance of threading.Lock). You can also construct your own context managers using the contextmanager decorator from contextlib. For instance, I often use this when I have to change the current directory temporarily and then return to where I was:
from contextlib import contextmanager
import os

@contextmanager
def working_directory(path):
    current_dir = os.getcwd()
    os.chdir(path)
    try:
        yield
    finally:
        os.chdir(current_dir)

with working_directory(""data/stuff""):
    # do something within data/stuff
# here I am back again in the original working directory

Here's another example that temporarily redirects sys.stdin, sys.stdout and sys.stderr to some other file handle and restores them later:
from contextlib import contextmanager
import sys

@contextmanager
def redirected(**kwds):
    stream_names = [""stdin"", ""stdout"", ""stderr""]
    old_streams = {}
    try:
        for sname in stream_names:
            stream = kwds.get(sname, None)
            if stream is not None and stream != getattr(sys, sname):
                old_streams[sname] = getattr(sys, sname)
                setattr(sys, sname, stream)
        yield
    finally:
        for sname, stream in old_streams.iteritems():
            setattr(sys, sname, stream)

with redirected(stdout=open(""/tmp/log.txt"", ""w"")):
     # these print statements will go to /tmp/log.txt
     print ""Test entry 1""
     print ""Test entry 2""
# back to the normal stdout
print ""Back to normal stdout again""

And finally, another example that creates a temporary folder and cleans it up when leaving the context:
from tempfile import mkdtemp
from shutil import rmtree

@contextmanager
def temporary_dir(*args, **kwds):
    name = mkdtemp(*args, **kwds)
    try:
        yield name
    finally:
        shutil.rmtree(name)

with temporary_dir() as dirname:
    # do whatever you want


",407,"
I would suggest two interesting lectures:  

PEP 343 The ""with"" Statement  
Effbot Understanding Python's
""with"" statement

1.
The with statement is used to wrap the execution of a block with methods defined by a context manager. This allows common try...except...finally usage patterns to be encapsulated for convenient reuse.
2.
You could do something like:
with open(""foo.txt"") as foo_file:
    data = foo_file.read()

OR
from contextlib import nested
with nested(A(), B(), C()) as (X, Y, Z):
   do_something()

OR (Python 3.1)
with open('data') as input_file, open('result', 'w') as output_file:
   for line in input_file:
     output_file.write(parse(line))

OR
lock = threading.Lock()
with lock:
    # Critical section of code

3.
 I don't see any Antipattern here.
Quoting Dive into Python: 

try..finally is good. with is better.

4.
I guess it's related to programmers's habit to use try..catch..finally statement from other languages.

<a href=""javascript:void(0)"" id=""loginlink"">login</a>

I've seen such hrefs many times, but I don't know what exactly that means.
","1,952,179",1449,412,javascript void ,https://stackoverflow.com/questions/1291942/what-does-javascriptvoid0-mean,14,"

The void operator evaluates the given
  expression and then returns undefined.
The void operator is often used merely
  to obtain the undefined primitive
  value, usually using “void(0)” (which
  is equivalent to “void 0”). In these
  cases, the global variable undefined
  can be used instead (assuming it has
  not been assigned to a non-default
  value).

An explanation is provided here: void operator.
The reason you’d want to do this with the href of a link is that normally, a javascript: URL will redirect the browser to a plain text version of the result of evaluating that JavaScript. But if the result is undefined, then the browser stays on the same page. void(0) is just a short and simple script that evaluates to undefined.
",1088,"
In addition to the technical answer, javascript:void means the author is Doing It Wrong.
There is no good reason to use a javascript: pseudo-URL(*). In practice it will cause confusion or errors should anyone try things like ‘bookmark link’, ‘open link in a new tab’, and so on. This happens quite a lot now people have got used to middle-click-for-new-tab: it looks like a link, you want to read it in a new tab, but it turns out to be not a real link at all, and gives unwanted results like a blank page or a JS error when middle-clicked.
<a href=""#""> is a common alternative which might arguably be less bad. However you must remember to return false from your onclick event handler to prevent the link being followed and scrolling up to the top of the page.
In some cases there may be an actual useful place to point the link to. For example if you have a control you can click on that opens up a previously-hidden <div id=""foo"">, it makes some sense to use <a href=""#foo""> to link to it. Or if there is a non-JavaScript way of doing the same thing (for example, ‘thispage.php?show=foo’ that sets foo visible to begin with), you can link to that.
Otherwise, if a link points only to some script, it is not really a link and should not be marked up as such. The usual approach would be to add the onclick to a <span>, <div>, or an <a> without an href and style it in some way to make it clear you can click on it. This is what StackOverflow [did at the time of writing; now it uses href=""#""].
The disadvantage of this is that you lose keyboard control, since you can't tab onto a span/div/bare-a or activate it with space. Whether this is actually a disadvantage depends on what sort of action the element is intended to take. You can, with some effort, attempt to mimic the keyboard interactability by adding a tabIndex to the element, and listening for a Space keypress. But it's never going to 100% reproduce the real browser behaviour, not least because different browsers can respond to the keyboard differently (not to mention non-visual browsers).
If you really want an element that isn't a link but which can be activated as normal by mouse or keyboard, what you want is a <button type=""button""> (or <input type=""button""> is just as good, for simple textual contents). You can always use CSS to restyle it so it looks more like a link than a button, if you want. But since it behaves like a button, that's how really you should mark it up.
(*: in site authoring, anyway. Obviously they are useful for bookmarklets. javascript: pseudo-URLs are a conceptual bizarreness: a locator that doesn't point to a location, but instead calls active code inside the current location. They have caused massive security problems for both browsers and webapps, and should never have been invented by Netscape.)

The most used approach is os.path.dirname(os.path.abspath(__file__)) but this really doesn't work if you execute the script from another one with exec().

To summarize the other answers and combine them with what I know, I found 10 main ways to do this (see below). Also, I wrote some performance tests (see results below). For example, if we want to find the sum of all of the keys and values of a map, we can write:

Using iterator and Map.Entry
long i = 0;
Iterator<Map.Entry<Integer, Integer>> it = map.entrySet().iterator();
while (it.hasNext()) {
    Map.Entry<Integer, Integer> pair = it.next();
    i += pair.getKey() + pair.getValue();
}

Using foreach and Map.Entry
long i = 0;
for (Map.Entry<Integer, Integer> pair : map.entrySet()) {
    i += pair.getKey() + pair.getValue();
}

Using forEach from Java 8
final long[] i = {0};
map.forEach((k, v) -> i[0] += k + v);

Using keySet and foreach
long i = 0;
for (Integer key : map.keySet()) {
    i += key + map.get(key);
}

Using keySet and iterator
long i = 0;
Iterator<Integer> itr2 = map.keySet().iterator();
while (itr2.hasNext()) {
    Integer key = itr2.next();
    i += key + map.get(key);
}

Using for and Map.Entry
long i = 0;
for (Iterator<Map.Entry<Integer, Integer>> entries = map.entrySet().iterator(); entries.hasNext(); ) {
    Map.Entry<Integer, Integer> entry = entries.next();
    i += entry.getKey() + entry.getValue();
}

Using the Java 8 Stream API
final long[] i = {0};
map.entrySet().stream().forEach(e -> i[0] += e.getKey() + e.getValue());

Using the Java 8 Stream API parallel
final long[] i = {0};
map.entrySet().stream().parallel().forEach(e -> i[0] += e.getKey() + e.getValue());

Using IterableMap of Apache Collections
long i = 0;
MapIterator<Integer, Integer> it = iterableMap.mapIterator();
while (it.hasNext()) {
    i += it.next() + it.getValue();
}

Using MutableMap of Eclipse (CS) collections
final long[] i = {0};
mutableMap.forEachKeyValue((key, value) -> {
    i[0] += key + value;
});

I've got a problem sending a file to a serverside PHP-script using jQuery's ajax-function.
It's possible to get the File-List with $('#fileinput').attr('files') but how is it possible to send this Data to the server? The resulting array ($_POST) on the serverside php-script is 0 (NULL) when using the file-input.
I know it is possible (though I didn't find any jQuery solutions until now, only Prototye code (http://webreflection.blogspot.com/2009/03/safari-4-multiple-upload-with-progress.html)).
This seems to be relatively new, so please do not mention file upload would be impossible via XHR/Ajax, because it's definitely working.
I need the functionality in Safari 5, FF and Chrome would be nice but are not essential.
My code for now is:
$.ajax({
    url: 'php/upload.php',
    data: $('#file').attr('files'),
    cache: false,
    contentType: 'multipart/form-data',
    processData: false,
    type: 'POST',
    success: function(data){
        alert(data);
    }
});

","898,920",576,297,jquery ajax file-upload multipartform-data form-data ,https://stackoverflow.com/questions/5392344/sending-multipart-formdata-with-jquery-ajax,14,"
Starting with Safari 5/Firefox 4, it’s easiest to use the FormData class:
var data = new FormData();
jQuery.each(jQuery('#file')[0].files, function(i, file) {
    data.append('file-'+i, file);
});

So now you have a FormData object, ready to be sent along with the XMLHttpRequest.
jQuery.ajax({
    url: 'php/upload.php',
    data: data,
    cache: false,
    contentType: false,
    processData: false,
    method: 'POST',
    type: 'POST', // For jQuery < 1.9
    success: function(data){
        alert(data);
    }
});

It’s imperative that you set the contentType option to false, forcing jQuery not to add a Content-Type header for you, otherwise, the boundary string will be missing from it.
Also, you must leave the processData flag set to false, otherwise, jQuery will try to convert your FormData into a string, which will fail.
You may now retrieve the file in PHP using:
$_FILES['file-0']

(There is only one file, file-0, unless you specified the multiple attribute on your file input, in which case, the numbers will increment with each file.)
Using the FormData emulation for older browsers
var opts = {
    url: 'php/upload.php',
    data: data,
    cache: false,
    contentType: false,
    processData: false,
    method: 'POST',
    type: 'POST', // For jQuery < 1.9
    success: function(data){
        alert(data);
    }
};
if(data.fake) {
    // Make sure no text encoding stuff is done by xhr
    opts.xhr = function() { var xhr = jQuery.ajaxSettings.xhr(); xhr.send = xhr.sendAsBinary; return xhr; }
    opts.contentType = ""multipart/form-data; boundary=""+data.boundary;
    opts.data = data.toString();
}
jQuery.ajax(opts);

Create FormData from an existing form
Instead of manually iterating the files, the FormData object can also be created with the contents of an existing form object:
var data = new FormData(jQuery('form')[0]);

Use a PHP native array instead of a counter
Just name your file elements the same and end the name in brackets:
jQuery.each(jQuery('#file')[0].files, function(i, file) {
    data.append('file[]', file);
});

$_FILES['file'] will then be an array containing the file upload fields for every file uploaded. I actually recommend this over my initial solution as it’s simpler to iterate over.

The de-facto unbiased shuffle algorithm is the Fisher-Yates (aka Knuth) Shuffle.
See https://github.com/coolaj86/knuth-shuffle
You can see a great visualization here (and the original post linked to this)


function shuffle(array) {
  var currentIndex = array.length, temporaryValue, randomIndex;

  // While there remain elements to shuffle...
  while (0 !== currentIndex) {

    // Pick a remaining element...
    randomIndex = Math.floor(Math.random() * currentIndex);
    currentIndex -= 1;

    // And swap it with the current element.
    temporaryValue = array[currentIndex];
    array[currentIndex] = array[randomIndex];
    array[randomIndex] = temporaryValue;
  }

  return array;
}

// Used like so
var arr = [2, 11, 37, 42];
shuffle(arr);
console.log(arr);



Some more info about the algorithm used.
",1651,"
Here's a JavaScript implementation of the Durstenfeld shuffle, an optimized version of Fisher-Yates:
/* Randomize array in-place using Durstenfeld shuffle algorithm */
function shuffleArray(array) {
    for (var i = array.length - 1; i > 0; i--) {
        var j = Math.floor(Math.random() * (i + 1));
        var temp = array[i];
        array[i] = array[j];
        array[j] = temp;
    }
}

It picks a random element for each original array element, and excludes it from the next draw, like picking randomly from a deck of cards.
This clever exclusion swaps the picked element with the current one, then picks the next random element from the remainder, looping backwards for optimal efficiency, ensuring the random pick is simplified (it can always start at 0), and thereby skipping the final element.
Algorithm runtime is O(n). Note that the shuffle is done in-place so if you don't want to modify the original array, first make a copy of it with .slice(0).

EDIT: Updating to ES6 / ECMAScript 2015
The new ES6 allows us to assign two variables at once. This is especially handy when we want to swap the values of two variables, as we can do it in one line of code. Here is a shorter form of the same function, using this feature. 
function shuffleArray(array) {
    for (let i = array.length - 1; i > 0; i--) {
        const j = Math.floor(Math.random() * (i + 1));
        [array[i], array[j]] = [array[j], array[i]];

Note to readers!
As commenters have pointed out, this solution is ""clever"", and as
  clever solutions often are, it's memory intensive and relatively
  slow. If performance is a concern for you, don't use this solution!
Potentially outdated: ECMAScript 2017 includes String.prototype.padStart and Number.prototype.toLocaleString is there since ECMAScript 3.1. Example:
var n=-0.1;
n.toLocaleString('en', {minimumIntegerDigits:4,minimumFractionDigits:2,useGrouping:false})

...will output ""-0000.10"".
// or 
const padded = (.1+"""").padStart(6,""0"");
`-${padded}`

...will output ""-0000.1"".

A simple function is all you need
function zeroFill( number, width )
{
  width -= number.toString().length;
  if ( width > 0 )
  {
    return new Array( width + (/\./.test( number ) ? 2 : 1) ).join( '0' ) + number;
  }
  return number + """"; // always return a string
}

you could bake this into a library if you want to conserve namespace or whatever.  Like with jQuery's extend.
",243,"
Simple way. You could add string multiplication for the pad and turn it into a function.
var pad = ""000000"";
var n = '5';
var result = (pad+n).slice(-pad.length);

As a function,
function paddy(num, padlen, padchar) {
    var pad_char = typeof padchar !== 'undefined' ? padchar : '0';
    var pad = new Array(1 + padlen).join(pad_char);
    return (pad + num).slice(-pad.length);

162,2808535,153724,How to round a number to n decimal places in Java,"
What I would like is a method to convert a double to a string which rounds using the half-up method - i.e. if the decimal to be rounded is 5, it always rounds up to the next number. This is the standard method of rounding most people expect in most situations.
I also would like only significant digits to be displayed - i.e. there should not be any trailing zeroes.
I know one method of doing this is to use the String.format method:
String.format(""%.5g%n"", 0.912385);

returns:
0.91239

which is great, however it always displays numbers with 5 decimal places even if they are not significant: 
String.format(""%.5g%n"", 0.912300);

returns:
0.91230

Another method is to use the DecimalFormatter:
DecimalFormat df = new DecimalFormat(""#.#####"");
df.format(0.912385);

returns:
0.91238

However as you can see this uses half-even rounding. That is it will round down if the previous digit is even. What I'd like is this:
0.912385 -> 0.91239
0.912300 -> 0.9123

What is the best way to achieve this in Java?
","1,691,627",1293,338,java decimal rounding digits ,https://stackoverflow.com/questions/153724/how-to-round-a-number-to-n-decimal-places-in-java,35,"
Use setRoundingMode, set the RoundingMode explicitly to handle your issue with the half-even round, then use the format pattern for your required output.
Example:
DecimalFormat df = new DecimalFormat(""#.####"");
df.setRoundingMode(RoundingMode.CEILING);
for (Number n : Arrays.asList(12, 123.12345, 0.23, 0.1, 2341234.212431324)) {
    Double d = n.doubleValue();
    System.out.println(df.format(d));
}

gives the output:
12
123.1235
0.23
0.1
2341234.2125


EDIT: The original answer does not address the accuracy of the double values. That is fine if you don't care much whether it rounds up or down. But if you want accurate rounding, then you need to take the expected accuracy of the values into account. Floating point values have a binary representation internally. That means that a value like 2.7735 does not actually have that exact value internally. It can be slightly larger or slightly smaller. If the internal value is slightly smaller, then it will not round up to 2.7740. To remedy that situation, you need to be aware of the accuracy of the values that you are working with, and add or subtract that value before rounding. For example, when you know that your values are accurate up to 6 digits, then to round half-way values up, add that accuracy to the value:
Double d = n.doubleValue() + 1e-6;

To round down, subtract the accuracy. 
",779,"
Assuming value is a double, you can do:
(double)Math.round(value * 100000d) / 100000d

That's for 5 digits precision. The number of zeros indicate the number of decimals.

There are two ways Python can be built and installed on Mac OS X.  One is as a traditional flat Unix-y shared library.  The other is known as a framework install, a file layout similar to other frameworks on OS X where all of the component directories (include, lib, bin) for the product are installed as subdirectories under the main framework directory.  The Fink project installs Pythons using the Unix shared library method.  Most other distributors, including the Apple-supplied Pythons in OS X, the python.org installers, and the MacPorts project, install framework versions of Python.  One of the advantages of a framework installation is that it will work properly with various OS X API calls that require a window manager connection (generally GUI-related interfaces) because the Python interpreter is packaged as an app bundle within the framework.
If you do need the functions in matplotlib that require the GUI functions, the simplest approach may be to switch to MacPorts which also packages matplotlib (port py27-matplotlib) and its dependencies.  If so, be careful not to mix packages between Fink and MacPorts.  It's best to stick with one or the other unless you are really careful. Adjust your shell path accordingly; it would be safest to remove all of the Fink packages and install MacPorts versions.

Some users may not want to change the backend for all of their scripts.  This page -- http://matplotlib.org/faq/usage_faq.html#what-is-a-backend -- tells another way:

I have a bit of code where I am looping through all the select boxes on a page and binding a .hover event to them to do a bit of twiddling with their width on mouse on/off.
This happens on page ready and works just fine.
The problem I have is that any select boxes I add via Ajax or DOM after the initial loop won't have the event bound.
I have found this plugin (jQuery Live Query Plugin), but before I add another 5k to my pages with a plugin, I want to see if anyone knows a way to do this, either with jQuery directly or by another option.
","882,741",1677,513,javascript jquery events unobtrusive-javascript ,https://stackoverflow.com/questions/203198/event-binding-on-dynamically-created-elements,23,"
As of jQuery 1.7 you should use jQuery.fn.on with the selector parameter filled:
$(staticAncestors).on(eventName, dynamicChild, function() {});

Explanation:
This is called event delegation and works as followed. The event is attached to a static parent (staticAncestors) of the element that should be handled. This jQuery handler is triggered every time the event triggers on this element or one of the descendant elements. The handler then checks if the element that triggered the event matches your selector (dynamicChild). When there is a match then your custom handler function is executed.

Prior to this, the recommended approach was to use live():
$(selector).live( eventName, function(){} );

However, live() was deprecated in 1.7 in favour of on(), and completely removed in 1.9. The live() signature:
$(selector).live( eventName, function(){} );

... can be replaced with the following on() signature:
$(document).on( eventName, selector, function(){} );


For example, if your page was dynamically creating elements with the class name dosomething you would bind the event to a parent which already exists (this is the nub of the problem here, you need something that exists to bind to, don't bind to the dynamic content), this can be (and the easiest option) is document. Though bear in mind document may not be the most efficient option.
$(document).on('mouseover mouseout', '.dosomething', function(){
    // what you want to happen when mouseover and mouseout 
    // occurs on elements that match '.dosomething'
});

Any parent that exists at the time the event is bound is fine. For example
$('.buttons').on('click', 'button', function(){
    // do something here
});

would apply to
<div class=""buttons"">
    <!-- <button>s that are generated dynamically and added here -->
</div>

",2323,"
There is a good explanation in the documentation of jQuery.fn.on.
In short:

Event handlers are bound only to the currently selected elements; they must exist on the page at the time your code makes the call to .on().

Thus in the following example #dataTable tbody tr must exist before the code is generated.
$(""#dataTable tbody tr"").on(""click"", function(event){
    console.log($(this).text());
});

If new HTML is being injected into the page, it is preferable to use delegated events to attach an event handler, as described next.
Delegated events have the advantage that they can process events from descendant elements that are added to the document at a later time. For example, if the table exists, but the rows are added dynamically using code, the following will handle it:
$(""#dataTable tbody"").on(""click"", ""tr"", function(event){
    console.log($(this).text());
});

In addition to their ability to handle events on descendant elements which are not yet created, another advantage of delegated events is their potential for much lower overhead when many elements must be monitored. On a data table with 1,000 rows in its tbody, the first code example attaches a handler to 1,000 elements.
A delegated-events approach (the second code example) attaches an event handler to only one element, the tbody, and the event only needs to bubble up one level (from the clicked tr to tbody).
Note: Delegated events do not work for SVG.

The other answers are correct, in that chmod -R 755 will set these permissions to all files and subfolders in the tree. But why on earth would you want to? It might make sense for the directories, but why set the execute bit on all the files? 
I suspect what you really want to do is set the directories to 755 and either leave the files alone or set them to 644. For this, you can use the find command. For example:
To change all the directories to 755 (drwxr-xr-x):
find /opt/lampp/htdocs -type d -exec chmod 755 {} \;

You can totally do that. It's just an ordering issue:
[unicode(x.strip()) if x is not None else '' for x in row]

In general,
[f(x) if condition else g(x) for x in sequence]

And, for list comprehensions with if conditions only,
[f(x) for x in sequence if condition]

Note that this actually uses a different language construct, a conditional expression, which itself is not part of the comprehension syntax, while the if after the for…in is part of list comprehensions and used to filter elements from the source iterable.

Conditional expressions can be used in all kinds of situations where you want to choose between two expression values based on some condition. This does the same as the ternary operator ?: that exists in other languages. For example:
value = 123
print(value, 'is', 'even' if value % 2 == 0 else 'odd')

One way:
def change(f):

I was just wondering how I could automatically increment the build (and version?) of my files using Visual Studio (2005).

In visual Studio 2008, the following works.
Find the AssemblyInfo.cs file and find these 2 lines:

[assembly: AssemblyFileVersion(""1.0.0.0"")]

You could try changing this to:
[assembly: AssemblyVersion(""1.0.*"")]
[assembly: AssemblyFileVersion(""1.0.*"")]

But this won't give you the desired result, you will end up with a Product Version of 1.0.* and a File Version of 1.0.0.0. Not what you want!
However, if you remove the second of these lines and just have:
[assembly: AssemblyVersion(""1.0.*"")]

Then the compiler will set the File Version to be equal to the Product Version and you will get your desired result of an automatically increment product and file version which are in sync. E.g. 1.0.3266.92689

I suggest a LinkedHashMap or a TreeMap. A LinkedHashMap keeps the keys in the order they were inserted, while a TreeMap is kept sorted via a Comparator or the natural Comparable ordering of the elements.
Since it doesn't have to keep the elements sorted, LinkedHashMap should be faster for most cases; TreeMap has O(log n) performance for containsKey, get, put, and remove, according to the Javadocs, while LinkedHashMap is O(1) for each.
If your API that only expects a predictable sort order, as opposed to a specific sort order, consider using the interfaces these two classes implement, NavigableMap or SortedMap. This will allow you not to leak specific implementations into your API and switch to either of those specific classes or a completely different implementation at will afterwards.

LinkedHashMap will return the elements in the order they were inserted into the map when you iterate over the keySet(), entrySet() or values() of the map.

I've recently started maintaining someone else's JavaScript code. I'm fixing bugs, adding features and also trying to tidy up the code and make it more consistent.
The previous developer used two ways of declaring functions and I can't work out if there is a reason behind it or not.
The two ways are:
var functionOne = function() {
    // Some code
};

function functionTwo() {
    // Some code
}

What are the reasons for using these two different methods and what are the pros and cons of each? Is there anything that can be done with one method that can't be done with the other?
","1,052,244",7020,2520,javascript function syntax idioms ,https://stackoverflow.com/questions/336859/var-functionname-function-vs-function-functionname,40,"
The difference is that functionOne is a function expression and so only defined when that line is reached, whereas functionTwo is a function declaration and is defined as soon as its surrounding function or script is executed (due to hoisting).  
For example, a function expression:


// TypeError: functionOne is not a function
functionOne();

var functionOne = function() {
  console.log(""Hello!"");
};



And, a function declaration:   


// Outputs: ""Hello!""
functionTwo();

function functionTwo() {
  console.log(""Hello!"");
}



Historically, function declarations defined within blocks were handled inconsistently between browsers. Strict mode (introduced in ES5) resolved this by scoping function declarations to their enclosing block.


'use strict';    
{ // note this block!
  function functionThree() {
    console.log(""Hello!"");
  }
}
functionThree(); // ReferenceError



",5148,"
First I want to correct Greg: function abc(){} is scoped too — the name abc is defined in the scope where this definition is encountered. Example:
function xyz(){
  function abc(){};
  // abc is defined here...
}
// ...but not here

Secondly, it is possible to combine both styles:
var xyz = function abc(){};

xyz is going to be defined as usual, abc is undefined in all browsers but Internet Explorer — do not rely on it being defined. But it will be defined inside its body:
var xyz = function abc(){
  // xyz is visible here
  // abc is visible here
}
// xyz is visible here
// abc is undefined here

If you want to alias functions on all browsers, use this kind of declaration:
function abc(){};
var xyz = abc;

In this case, both xyz and abc are aliases of the same object:
console.log(xyz === abc); // prints ""true""

One compelling reason to use the combined style is the ""name"" attribute of function objects (not supported by Internet Explorer). Basically when you define a function like
function abc(){};
console.log(abc.name); // prints ""abc""

its name is automatically assigned. But when you define it like
var abc = function(){};
console.log(abc.name); // prints """"

its name is empty — we created an anonymous function and assigned it to some variable.
Another good reason to use the combined style is to use a short internal name to refer to itself, while providing a long non-conflicting name for external users:
// Assume really.long.external.scoped is {}
really.long.external.scoped.name = function shortcut(n){
  // Let it call itself recursively:
  shortcut(n - 1);
  // ...
  // Let it pass itself as a callback:
  someFunction(shortcut);
  // ...
}

In the example above we can do the same with an external name, but it'll be too unwieldy (and slower).
(Another way to refer to itself is to use arguments.callee, which is still relatively long, and not supported in the strict mode.)
Deep down, JavaScript treats both statements differently. This is a function declaration:
function abc(){}

abc here is defined everywhere in the current scope:
// We can call it here
abc(); // Works

// Yet, it is defined down there.
function abc(){}

// We can call it again
abc(); // Works

Also, it hoisted through a return statement:
// We can call it here
abc(); // Works
return;
function abc(){}

This is a function expression:
var xyz = function(){};

xyz here is defined from the point of assignment:
// We can't call it here
xyz(); // UNDEFINED!!!

// Now it is defined
xyz = function(){}

// We can call it here
xyz(); // works

Function declaration vs. function expression is the real reason why there is a difference demonstrated by Greg.
Fun fact:
var xyz = function abc(){};
console.log(xyz.name); // Prints ""abc""

Personally, I prefer the ""function expression"" declaration because this way I can control the visibility. When I define the function like
var abc = function(){};

I know that I defined the function locally. When I define the function like
abc = function(){};

I know that I defined it globally providing that I didn't define abc anywhere in the chain of scopes. This style of definition is resilient even when used inside eval(). While the definition
function abc(){};

depends on the context and may leave you guessing where it is actually defined, especially in the case of eval() — the answer is: It depends on the browser.

174,5316697,14220321,How do I return the response from an asynchronous call?,"
I have a function foo which makes an asynchronous request. How can I return the response/result from foo?
I tried returning the value from the callback, as well as assigning the result to a local variable inside the function and returning that one, but none of those ways actually return the response (they all return undefined or whatever the initial value of the variable result is).
Example using jQuery's ajax function:
function foo() {
    var result;

    $.ajax({
        url: '...',
        success: function(response) {
            result = response;
            // return response; // <- I tried that one as well
        }
    });

    return result; // It always returns `undefined`
}

Example using node.js:
function foo() {
    var result;

    fs.readFile(""path/to/file"", function(err, data) {
        result = data;
        // return data; // <- I tried that one as well
    });

    return result; // It always returns `undefined`
}

Example using the then block of a promise:
function foo() {
    var result;

    fetch(url).then(function(response) {
        result = response;
        // return response; // <- I tried that one as well
    });

    return result; // It always returns `undefined`
}

→ For a more general explanation of async behaviour with different examples, please see Why is my variable unaltered after I modify it inside of a function? - Asynchronous code reference
→ If you already understand the problem, skip to the possible solutions below.

The problem
The A in Ajax stands for asynchronous . That means sending the request (or rather receiving the response) is taken out of the normal execution flow. In your example, $.ajax returns immediately and the next statement, return result;, is executed before the function you passed as success callback was even called.
Here is an analogy which hopefully makes the difference between synchronous and asynchronous flow clearer:
Synchronous
Imagine you make a phone call to a friend and ask him to look something up for you. Although it might take a while, you wait on the phone and stare into space, until your friend gives you the answer that you needed.
The same is happening when you make a function call containing ""normal"" code:
function findItem() {
    var item;
    while(item_not_found) {
        // search
    }
    return item;
}

var item = findItem();

// Do something with item
doSomethingElse();

Even though findItem might take a long time to execute, any code coming after var item = findItem(); has to wait until the function returns the result.
Asynchronous
You call your friend again for the same reason. But this time you tell him that you are in a hurry and he should call you back on your mobile phone. You hang up, leave the house, and do whatever you planned to do. Once your friend calls you back, you are dealing with the information he gave to you.
That's exactly what's happening when you do an Ajax request.
findItem(function(item) {
    // Do something with the item
});
doSomethingElse();

Instead of waiting for the response, the execution continues immediately and the statement after the Ajax call is executed. To get the response eventually, you provide a function to be called once the response was received, a callback (notice something? call back ?). Any statement coming after that call is executed before the callback is called.

Solution(s)
Embrace the asynchronous nature of JavaScript! While certain asynchronous operations provide synchronous counterparts (so does ""Ajax""), it's generally discouraged to use them, especially in a browser context.
Why is it bad do you ask?
JavaScript runs in the UI thread of the browser and any long-running process will lock the UI, making it unresponsive. Additionally, there is an upper limit on the execution time for JavaScript and the browser will ask the user whether to continue the execution or not.
All of this is a really bad user experience. The user won't be able to tell whether everything is working fine or not. Furthermore, the effect will be worse for users with a slow connection.
In the following we will look at three different solutions that are all building on top of each other:

Promises with async/await (ES2017+, available in older browsers if you use a transpiler or regenerator)
Callbacks (popular in node)
Promises with then() (ES2015+, available in older browsers if you use one of the many promise libraries)

All three are available in current browsers, and node 7+.

ES2017+: Promises with async/await
The ECMAScript version released in 2017 introduced syntax-level support for asynchronous functions. With the help of async and await, you can write asynchronous in a ""synchronous style"". The code is still asynchronous, but it's easier to read/understand.
async/await builds on top of promises: an async function always returns a promise. await ""unwraps"" a promise and either result in the value the promise was resolved with or throws an error if the promise was rejected.
Important: You can only use await inside an async function. Right now, top-level await isn't yet supported, so you might have to make an async IIFE (Immediately Invoked Function Expression) to start an async context.
You can read more about async and await on MDN.
Here is an example that builds on top of delay above:
// Using 'superagent' which will return a promise.
var superagent = require('superagent')

// This is isn't declared as `async` because it already returns a promise
function delay() {
  // `delay` returns a promise
  return new Promise(function(resolve, reject) {
    // Only `delay` is able to resolve or reject the promise
    setTimeout(function() {
      resolve(42); // After 3 seconds, resolve the promise with value 42
    }, 3000);
  });
}


async function getAllBooks() {
  try {
    // GET a list of book IDs of the current user
    var bookIDs = await superagent.get('/user/books');
    // wait for 3 seconds (just for the sake of this example)
    await delay();
    // GET information about each book
    return await superagent.get('/books/ids='+JSON.stringify(bookIDs));
  } catch(error) {
    // If any of the awaited promises was rejected, this catch block
    // would catch the rejection reason
    return null;
  }
}

// Start an IIFE to use `await` at the top level
(async function(){
  let books = await getAllBooks();
  console.log(books);
})();

Current browser and node versions support async/await. You can also support older environments by transforming your code to ES5 with the help of regenerator (or tools that use regenerator, such as Babel).

Let functions accept callbacks
A callback is when function 1 is passed to function 2. Function 2 can call function 1 whenever it is ready. In the context of an asynchronous process, the callback will be called whenever the asynchronous process is done. Usually, the result is passed to the callback.
In the example of the question, you can make foo accept a callback and use it as success callback. So this
var result = foo();
// Code that depends on 'result'

becomes
foo(function(result) {
    // Code that depends on 'result'
});

Here we defined the function ""inline"" but you can pass any function reference:
function myCallback(result) {
    // Code that depends on 'result'
}

foo(myCallback);

foo itself is defined as follows:
function foo(callback) {
    $.ajax({
        // ...
        success: callback
    });
}

callback will refer to the function we pass to foo when we call it and we pass it on to success. I.e. once the Ajax request is successful, $.ajax will call callback and pass the response to the callback (which can be referred to with result, since this is how we defined the callback).
You can also process the response before passing it to the callback:
function foo(callback) {
    $.ajax({
        // ...
        success: function(response) {
            // For example, filter the response
            callback(filtered_response);
        }
    });
}

It's easier to write code using callbacks than it may seem. After all, JavaScript in the browser is heavily event-driven (DOM events). Receiving the Ajax response is nothing else but an event.
Difficulties could arise when you have to work with third-party code, but most problems can be solved by just thinking through the application flow.

ES2015+: Promises with then()
The Promise API is a new feature of ECMAScript 6 (ES2015), but it has good browser support already. There are also many libraries which implement the standard Promises API and provide additional methods to ease the use and composition of asynchronous functions (e.g. bluebird).
Promises are containers for future values. When the promise receives the value (it is resolved) or when it is canceled (rejected), it notifies all of its ""listeners"" who want to access this value.
The advantage over plain callbacks is that they allow you to decouple your code and they are easier to compose.
Here is an example of using a promise:
function delay() {
  // `delay` returns a promise
  return new Promise(function(resolve, reject) {
    // Only `delay` is able to resolve or reject the promise
    setTimeout(function() {
      resolve(42); // After 3 seconds, resolve the promise with value 42
    }, 3000);
  });
}

delay()
  .then(function(v) { // `delay` returns a promise
    console.log(v); // Log the value once it is resolved
  })
  .catch(function(v) {
    // Or do something else if it is rejected 
    // (it would not happen in this example, since `reject` is not called).
  });

Applied to our Ajax call we could use promises like this:
function ajax(url) {
  return new Promise(function(resolve, reject) {
    var xhr = new XMLHttpRequest();
    xhr.onload = function() {
      resolve(this.responseText);
    };
    xhr.onerror = reject;
    xhr.open('GET', url);
    xhr.send();
  });
}

ajax(""/echo/json"")
  .then(function(result) {
    // Code depending on result
  })
  .catch(function() {
    // An error occurred
  });

Describing all the advantages that promise offer is beyond the scope of this answer, but if you write new code, you should seriously consider them. They provide a great abstraction and separation of your code.
More information about promises: HTML5 rocks - JavaScript Promises
Side note: jQuery's deferred objects
Deferred objects are jQuery's custom implementation of promises (before the Promise API was standardized). They behave almost like promises but expose a slightly different API.
Every Ajax method of jQuery already returns a ""deferred object"" (actually a promise of a deferred object) which you can just return from your function:
function ajax() {
    return $.ajax(...);
}

ajax().done(function(result) {
    // Code depending on result
}).fail(function() {
    // An error occurred
});

Side note: Promise gotchas
Keep in mind that promises and deferred objects are just containers for a future value, they are not the value itself. For example, suppose you had the following:
function checkPassword() {
    return $.ajax({
        url: '/password',
        data: {
            username: $('#username').val(),
            password: $('#password').val()
        },
        type: 'POST',
        dataType: 'json'
    });
}

if (checkPassword()) {
    // Tell the user they're logged in
}

This code misunderstands the above asynchrony issues. Specifically, $.ajax() doesn't freeze the code while it checks the '/password' page on your server - it sends a request to the server and while it waits, it immediately returns a jQuery Ajax Deferred object, not the response from the server. That means the if statement is going to always get this Deferred object, treat it as true, and proceed as though the user is logged in. Not good.
But the fix is easy:
checkPassword()
.done(function(r) {
    if (r) {
        // Tell the user they're logged in
    } else {
        // Tell the user their password was bad
    }
})
.fail(function(x) {
    // Tell the user something bad happened
});


Not recommended: Synchronous ""Ajax"" calls
As I mentioned, some(!) asynchronous operations have synchronous counterparts. I don't advocate their use, but for completeness' sake, here is how you would perform a synchronous call:
Without jQuery
If you directly use a XMLHttpRequest object, pass false as third argument to .open.
jQuery
If you use jQuery, you can set the async option to false. Note that this option is deprecated since jQuery 1.8.
You can then either still use a success callback or access the responseText property of the jqXHR object:
function foo() {
    var jqXHR = $.ajax({
        //...
        async: false
    });
    return jqXHR.responseText;
}

If you use any other jQuery Ajax method, such as $.get, $.getJSON, etc., you have to change it to $.ajax (since you can only pass configuration parameters to $.ajax).
Heads up! It is not possible to make a synchronous JSONP request. JSONP by its very nature is always asynchronous (one more reason to not even consider this option).

If you're not using jQuery in your code, this answer is for you
Your code should be something along the lines of this:
function foo() {
    var httpRequest = new XMLHttpRequest();
    httpRequest.open('GET', ""/echo/json"");
    httpRequest.send();
    return httpRequest.responseText;
}

var result = foo(); // always ends up being 'undefined'

Felix Kling did a fine job writing an answer for people using jQuery for AJAX, I've decided to provide an alternative for people who aren't.
(Note, for those using the new fetch API, Angular or promises I've added another answer below)

What you're facing
This is a short summary of ""Explanation of the problem"" from the other answer, if you're not sure after reading this, read that.
The A in AJAX stands for asynchronous. That means sending the request (or rather receiving the response) is taken out of the normal execution flow. In your example, .send returns immediately and the next statement, return result;, is executed before the function you passed as success callback was even called.
This means when you're returning, the listener you've defined did not execute yet, which means the value you're returning has not been defined.
Here is a simple analogy
function getFive(){ 
    var a;
    setTimeout(function(){
         a=5;
    },10);
    return a;
}

(Fiddle)
The value of a returned is undefined since the a=5 part has not executed yet. AJAX acts like this, you're returning the value before the server got the chance to tell your browser what that value is.
One possible solution to this problem is to code re-actively , telling your program what to do when the calculation completed.
function onComplete(a){ // When the code completes, do this
    alert(a);
}

function getFive(whenDone){ 
    var a;
    setTimeout(function(){
         a=5;
         whenDone(a);
    },10);
}

This is called CPS. Basically, we're passing getFive an action to perform when it completes, we're telling our code how to react when an event completes (like our AJAX call, or in this case the timeout).
Usage would be:
getFive(onComplete);

Which should alert ""5"" to the screen. (Fiddle).
Possible solutions
There are basically two ways how to solve this:

Make the AJAX call synchronous (lets call it SJAX).
Restructure your code to work properly with callbacks.

1. Synchronous AJAX - Don't do it!!
As for synchronous AJAX, don't do it! Felix's answer raises some compelling arguments about why it's a bad idea. To sum it up, it'll freeze the user's browser until the server returns the response and create a very bad user experience. Here is another short summary taken from MDN on why:

XMLHttpRequest supports both synchronous and asynchronous communications. In general, however, asynchronous requests should be preferred to synchronous requests for performance reasons.
In short, synchronous requests block the execution of code... ...this can cause serious issues...

If you have to do it, you can pass a flag: Here is how:
var request = new XMLHttpRequest();
request.open('GET', 'yourURL', false);  // `false` makes the request synchronous
request.send(null);
 
if (request.status === 200) {// That's HTTP for 'ok'
  console.log(request.responseText);
}

2. Restructure code
Let your function accept a callback. In the example code foo can be made to accept a callback. We'll be telling our code how to react when foo completes.
So:
var result = foo();
// code that depends on `result` goes here

Becomes:
foo(function(result) {
    // code that depends on `result`
});

Here we passed an anonymous function, but we could just as easily pass a reference to an existing function, making it look like:
function myHandler(result) {
    // code that depends on `result`
}
foo(myHandler);

For more details on how this sort of callback design is done, check Felix's answer.
Now, let's define foo itself to act accordingly
function foo(callback) {
    var httpRequest = new XMLHttpRequest();
    httpRequest.onload = function(){ // when the request is loaded
       callback(httpRequest.responseText);// we're calling our method
    };
    httpRequest.open('GET', ""/echo/json"");
    httpRequest.send();
}

(fiddle)
We have now made our foo function accept an action to run when the AJAX completes successfully, we can extend this further by checking if the response status is not 200 and acting accordingly (create a fail handler and such). Effectively solving our issue.
If you're still having a hard time understanding this read the AJAX getting started guide at MDN.

In the example of the question, you can make foo accept a callback and use it as success callback. So this
var result = foo();
// Code that depends on 'result'

becomes
foo(function(result) {
    // Code that depends on 'result'
});

Here we defined the function ""inline"" but you can pass any function reference:
function myCallback(result) {
    // Code that depends on 'result'
}

foo(myCallback);

foo itself is defined as follows:
function foo(callback) {
    $.ajax({
        // ...
        success: callback
    });
}

callback will refer to the function we pass to foo when we call it and we pass it on to success. I.e. once the Ajax request is successful, $.ajax will call callback and pass the response to the callback (which can be referred to with result, since this is how we defined the callback).
You can also process the response before passing it to the callback:
function foo(callback) {
    $.ajax({
        // ...
        success: function(response) {
            // For example, filter the response
            callback(filtered_response);
        }
    });
}

It's easier to write code using callbacks than it may seem. After all, JavaScript in the browser is heavily event-driven (DOM events). Receiving the Ajax response is nothing else but an event.
Difficulties could arise when you have to work with third-party code, but most problems can be solved by just thinking through the application flow.

ES2015+: Promises with then()
The Promise API is a new feature of ECMAScript 6 (ES2015), but it has good browser support already. There are also many libraries which implement the standard Promises API and provide additional methods to ease the use and composition of asynchronous functions (e.g. bluebird).
Promises are containers for future values. When the promise receives the value (it is resolved) or when it is canceled (rejected), it notifies all of its ""listeners"" who want to access this value.
The advantage over plain callbacks is that they allow you to decouple your code and they are easier to compose.
Here is an example of using a promise:
function delay() {
  // `delay` returns a promise
  return new Promise(function(resolve, reject) {
    // Only `delay` is able to resolve or reject the promise
    setTimeout(function() {
      resolve(42); // After 3 seconds, resolve the promise with value 42
    }, 3000);
  });
}

delay()
  .then(function(v) { // `delay` returns a promise
    console.log(v); // Log the value once it is resolved
  })
  .catch(function(v) {
    // Or do something else if it is rejected 
    // (it would not happen in this example, since `reject` is not called).
  });

Applied to our Ajax call we could use promises like this:
function ajax(url) {
  return new Promise(function(resolve, reject) {
    var xhr = new XMLHttpRequest();
    xhr.onload = function() {
      resolve(this.responseText);
    };
    xhr.onerror = reject;
    xhr.open('GET', url);
    xhr.send();
  });
}

ajax(""/echo/json"")
  .then(function(result) {
    // Code depending on result
  })
  .catch(function() {
    // An error occurred
  });

Describing all the advantages that promise offer is beyond the scope of this answer, but if you write new code, you should seriously consider them. They provide a great abstraction and separation of your code.

Side note: jQuery's deferred objects
Deferred objects are jQuery's custom implementation of promises (before the Promise API was standardized). They behave almost like promises but expose a slightly different API.
Every Ajax method of jQuery already returns a ""deferred object"" (actually a promise of a deferred object) which you can just return from your function:
function ajax() {
    return $.ajax(...);
}

ajax().done(function(result) {
    // Code depending on result
}).fail(function() {
    // An error occurred
});

Side note: Promise gotchas
Keep in mind that promises and deferred objects are just containers for a future value, they are not the value itself. For example, suppose you had the following:
function checkPassword() {
    return $.ajax({
        url: '/password',
        data: {
            username: $('#username').val(),
            password: $('#password').val()
        },
        type: 'POST',
        dataType: 'json'
    });
}

if (checkPassword()) {
    // Tell the user they're logged in
}

This code misunderstands the above asynchrony issues. Specifically, $.ajax() doesn't freeze the code while it checks the '/password' page on your server - it sends a request to the server and while it waits, it immediately returns a jQuery Ajax Deferred object, not the response from the server. That means the if statement is going to always get this Deferred object, treat it as true, and proceed as though the user is logged in. Not good.
But the fix is easy:
checkPassword()
.done(function(r) {
    if (r) {
        // Tell the user they're logged in
    } else {
        // Tell the user their password was bad
    }
})
.fail(function(x) {
    // Tell the user something bad happened
});


Not recommended: Synchronous ""Ajax"" calls
As I mentioned, some(!) asynchronous operations have synchronous counterparts. I don't advocate their use, but for completeness' sake, here is how you would perform a synchronous call:
Without jQuery
If you directly use a XMLHttpRequest object, pass false as third argument to .open.
jQuery
If you use jQuery, you can set the async option to false. Note that this option is deprecated since jQuery 1.8.
You can then either still use a success callback or access the responseText property of the jqXHR object:
function foo() {
    var jqXHR = $.ajax({
        //...
        async: false
    });
    return jqXHR.responseText;
}

If you use any other jQuery Ajax method, such as $.get, $.getJSON, etc., you have to change it to $.ajax (since you can only pass configuration parameters to $.ajax).
Heads up! It is not possible to make a synchronous JSONP request. JSONP by its very nature is always asynchronous (one more reason to not even consider this option).

If you're not using jQuery in your code, this answer is for you
Your code should be something along the lines of this:
function foo() {
    var httpRequest = new XMLHttpRequest();
    httpRequest.open('GET', ""/echo/json"");
    httpRequest.send();
    return httpRequest.responseText;
}

var result = foo(); // always ends up being 'undefined'

Felix Kling did a fine job writing an answer for people using jQuery for AJAX, I've decided to provide an alternative for people who aren't.
(Note, for those using the new fetch API, Angular or promises I've added another answer below)

What you're facing
This is a short summary of ""Explanation of the problem"" from the other answer, if you're not sure after reading this, read that.
The A in AJAX stands for asynchronous. That means sending the request (or rather receiving the response) is taken out of the normal execution flow. In your example, .send returns immediately and the next statement, return result;, is executed before the function you passed as success callback was even called.
This means when you're returning, the listener you've defined did not execute yet, which means the value you're returning has not been defined.
Here is a simple analogy
function getFive(){ 
    var a;
    setTimeout(function(){
         a=5;
    },10);
    return a;
}

(Fiddle)
The value of a returned is undefined since the a=5 part has not executed yet. AJAX acts like this, you're returning the value before the server got the chance to tell your browser what that value is.
One possible solution to this problem is to code re-actively , telling your program what to do when the calculation completed.
function onComplete(a){ // When the code completes, do this
    alert(a);
}

function getFive(whenDone){ 
    var a;
    setTimeout(function(){
         a=5;
         whenDone(a);
    },10);
}

This is called CPS. Basically, we're passing getFive an action to perform when it completes, we're telling our code how to react when an event completes (like our AJAX call, or in this case the timeout).
Usage would be:
getFive(onComplete);

Which should alert ""5"" to the screen. (Fiddle).
Possible solutions
There are basically two ways how to solve this:

Make the AJAX call synchronous (lets call it SJAX).
Restructure your code to work properly with callbacks.

1. Synchronous AJAX - Don't do it!!
As for synchronous AJAX, don't do it! Felix's answer raises some compelling arguments about why it's a bad idea. To sum it up, it'll freeze the user's browser until the server returns the response and create a very bad user experience. Here is another short summary taken from MDN on why:

XMLHttpRequest supports both synchronous and asynchronous communications. In general, however, asynchronous requests should be preferred to synchronous requests for performance reasons.
In short, synchronous requests block the execution of code... ...this can cause serious issues...

If you have to do it, you can pass a flag: Here is how:
var request = new XMLHttpRequest();
request.open('GET', 'yourURL', false);  // `false` makes the request synchronous
request.send(null);
 
if (request.status === 200) {// That's HTTP for 'ok'
  console.log(request.responseText);
}

2. Restructure code
Let your function accept a callback. In the example code foo can be made to accept a callback. We'll be telling our code how to react when foo completes.
So:
var result = foo();
// code that depends on `result` goes here

Becomes:
foo(function(result) {
    // code that depends on `result`
});

Here we passed an anonymous function, but we could just as easily pass a reference to an existing function, making it look like:
function myHandler(result) {
    // code that depends on `result`
}
foo(myHandler);

For more details on how this sort of callback design is done, check Felix's answer.
Now, let's define foo itself to act accordingly
function foo(callback) {
    var httpRequest = new XMLHttpRequest();
    httpRequest.onload = function(){ // when the request is loaded
       callback(httpRequest.responseText);// we're calling our method
    };
    httpRequest.open('GET', ""/echo/json"");
    httpRequest.send();
}

(fiddle)
We have now made our foo function accept an action to run when the AJAX completes successfully, we can extend this further by checking if the response status is not 200 and acting accordingly (create a fail handler and such). Effectively solving our issue.
If you're still having a hard time understanding this read the AJAX getting started guide at MDN.

I believe you want to set the backdrop value to static. If you want to avoid the window to close when using the Esc key, you have to set another value.
Example:
<a data-controls-modal=""your_div_id""
   data-backdrop=""static""
   data-keyboard=""false""
   href=""#"">

OR if you are using JavaScript:
$('#myModal').modal({
  backdrop: 'static',
  keyboard: false
});

",698,"
Just set the backdrop property to 'static'.
$('#myModal').modal({
  backdrop: 'static',
  keyboard: true
})

You may also want to set the keyboard property to false because that prevents the modal from being closed by pressing the Esc key on the keyboard.
$('#myModal').modal({
  backdrop: 'static',
  keyboard: false
})

myModal is the ID of the div that contains your modal content.

IF EXIST ""C:\some other folder with space\myfile.txt"" set __myVariable=C:\some other folder with space\myfile.txt

Note: this was originally written on Installing ADB on macOS but that question was closed as a duplicate of this one.
Note for zsh users: replace all references to ~/.bash_profile with ~/.zshrc.
Option 1 - Using Homebrew
This is the easiest way and will provide automatic updates.

Install homebrew
 /bin/bash -c ""$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install.sh)""


Install adb
 brew cask install android-platform-tools


Start using adb
 adb devices




Option 2 - Manually (just the platform tools)
This is the easiest way to get a manual installation of ADB and Fastboot.

Delete your old installation (optional)
 rm -rf ~/.android-sdk-macosx/


Navigate to https://developer.android.com/studio/releases/platform-tools.html and click on the SDK Platform-Tools for Mac link.

Go to your Downloads folder
 cd ~/Downloads/


Unzip the tools you downloaded
 unzip platform-tools-latest*.zip 


Move them somewhere you won't accidentally delete them
 mkdir ~/.android-sdk-macosx
 mv platform-tools/ ~/.android-sdk-macosx/platform-tools


Add platform-tools to your path
 echo 'export PATH=$PATH:~/.android-sdk-macosx/platform-tools/' >> ~/.bash_profile


Refresh your bash profile (or restart your terminal app)
 source ~/.bash_profile


Start using adb
 adb devices



Option 3 - If you already have Android Studio installed

Add platform-tools to your path
 echo 'export ANDROID_HOME=/Users/$USER/Library/Android/sdk' >> ~/.bash_profile
 echo 'export PATH=${PATH}:$ANDROID_HOME/tools:$ANDROID_HOME/platform-tools' >> ~/.bash_profile


Refresh your bash profile (or restart your terminal app)
 source ~/.bash_profile


Start using adb
 adb devices



Option 4 - MacPorts

Install the Android SDK:
 sudo port install android


Run the SDK manager:
 sh /opt/local/share/java/android-sdk-macosx/tools/android


Uncheck everything but Android SDK Platform-tools (optional)

Install the packages, accepting licenses. Close the SDK Manager.

Add platform-tools to your path; in MacPorts, they're in /opt/local/share/java/android-sdk-macosx/platform-tools.  E.g., for bash:
 echo 'export PATH=$PATH:/opt/local/share/java/android-sdk-macosx/platform-tools' >> ~/.bash_profile


Refresh your bash profile (or restart your terminal/shell):
source ~/.bash_profile


Start using adb:
adb devices



Option 5 - Manually (with SDK Manager)

Delete your old installation (optional)
 rm -rf ~/.android-sdk-macosx/


Download the Mac SDK Tools from the Android developer site under ""Get just the command line tools"". Make sure you save them to your Downloads folder.

Go to your Downloads folder
 cd ~/Downloads/


Unzip the tools you downloaded
 unzip tools_r*-macosx.zip 


Move them somewhere you won't accidentally delete them
 mkdir ~/.android-sdk-macosx
 mv tools/ ~/.android-sdk-macosx/tools


Run the SDK Manager
 sh ~/.android-sdk-macosx/tools/android


Uncheck everything but Android SDK Platform-tools (optional)




Click Install Packages, accept licenses, click Install. Close the SDK Manager window.



Add platform-tools to your path

However, conversely there is no way to explicitly set the seed so it can be difficult to reproduce results in situations where that is useful such as testing or saving game states or similar.  In those situations, the pre-Java 1.7 technique shown below can be used.

    // use ThreadLocalRandom (if using at least Java 1.7).
    // 
    // In particular, do NOT do 'Random rand = new Random()' here or you
    // will get not very good / not very random results.
    Random rand;

    // nextInt is normally exclusive of the top value,
    // so add 1 to make it inclusive
    int randomNum = rand.nextInt((max - min) + 1) + min;

    return randomNum;
}

See the relevant JavaDoc.  In practice, the java.util.Random class is often preferable to java.lang.Math.random().
In particular, there is no need to reinvent the random integer generation wheel when there is a straightforward API within the standard library to accomplish the task.

This can be the result of a .Net framework version incompatibility between two projects. 
It can happen in two ways: 

a client profile project referencing a full framework project; or 
an older framework version targeting a newer framework version

For example it will happen when an application is set to target the .Net 4 Client Profile framework, and the project it references targets the full .Net 4 framework.
So to make that clearer:

Project A targets the Client Profile framework
Project A references Project B
Project B targets the full framework

The solution in this case is to either upgrade the framework target of the application (Project A), or downgrade the target of referenced assembly (Project B). It is okay for a full framework app to reference/consume a client profile framework assembly, but not the other way round (client profile cannot reference full framework targeted assembly).
Note that you can also get this error when you create a new project in VS2012 or VS2013 (which uses .Net 4.5 as the default framework) and:  

the referencing project(s) use .Net 4.0 (this is common when you have migrated from VS2010 to VS2012 or VS2013 and you then add a new project)  
the referenced projects use a greater version i.e. 4.5.1 or 4.5.3 (you've re-targeted your existing projects to the latest version, but VS still creates new projects targeting v4.5, and you then reference those older projects from the new project)

Starting from Java8 it is possible to use String.join().
String.join("", "", new String[]{""Hello"", ""World"", ""!""})

Generates:
Hello, World, !

Otherwise, Apache Commons Lang has a StringUtils class which has a join function which will join arrays together to make a String.
For example:
StringUtils.join(new String[] {""Hello"", ""World"", ""!""}, "", "")

Generates the following String:

In fact, it does exist, but few people know it. Meet pathinfo():
$ext = pathinfo($filename, PATHINFO_EXTENSION);

This is fast and built-in. pathinfo() can give you other information, such as canonical path, depending on the constant you pass to it.
Remember that if you want to be able to deal with non ASCII characters, you need to set the locale first. E.G:
setlocale(LC_ALL,'en_US.UTF-8');

Also, note this doesn't take into consideration the file content or mime-type, you only get the extension. But it's what you asked for.
Lastly, note that this works only for a file path, not a URL resources path, which is covered using PARSE_URL.

What's the difference?
What are the advantages / disadvantages of tuples / lists?
","421,253",1045,379,python list tuples ,https://stackoverflow.com/questions/626759/whats-the-difference-between-lists-and-tuples,20,"
Apart from tuples being immutable there is also a semantic distinction that should guide their usage. Tuples are heterogeneous data structures (i.e., their entries have different meanings), while lists are homogeneous sequences. Tuples have structure, lists have order. 
Using this distinction makes code more explicit and understandable.
One example would be pairs of page and line number to reference locations in a book, e.g.:
my_location = (42, 11)  # page number, line number

You can then use this as a key in a dictionary to store notes on locations. A list on the other hand could be used to store multiple locations. Naturally one might want to add or remove locations from the list, so it makes sense that lists are mutable. On the other hand it doesn't make sense to add or remove items from an existing location - hence tuples are immutable.
There might be situations where you want to change items within an existing location tuple, for example when iterating through the lines of a page. But tuple immutability forces you to create a new location tuple for each new value. This seems inconvenient on the face of it, but using immutable data like this is a cornerstone of value types and functional programming techniques, which can have substantial advantages.
There are some interesting articles on this issue, e.g. ""Python Tuples are Not Just Constant Lists"" or ""Understanding tuples vs. lists in Python"". The official Python documentation also mentions this

""Tuples are immutable, and usually contain an heterogeneous sequence ..."".

In a statically typed language like Haskell the values in a tuple generally have different types and the length of the tuple must be fixed. In a list the values all have the same type and the length is not fixed. So the difference is very obvious.
Finally there is the namedtuple in Python, which makes sense because a tuple is already supposed to have structure. This underlines the idea that tuples are a light-weight alternative to classes and instances.
",1039,"
Difference between list and tuple

Literal
someTuple = (1,2)
someList  = [1,2] 

Size
a = tuple(range(1000))
b = list(range(1000))

a.__sizeof__() # 8024
b.__sizeof__() # 9088

Due to the smaller size of a tuple operation, it becomes a bit faster, but not that much to mention about until you have a huge number of elements.
Permitted operations
b    = [1,2]   
b[0] = 3       # [3, 2]

a    = (1,2)
a[0] = 3       # Error

That also means that you can't delete an element or sort a tuple. 
However, you could add a new element to both list and tuple with the only difference that since the tuple is immutable, you are not really adding an element but you are creating a new tuple, so the id of will change
a     = (1,2)
b     = [1,2]  

id(a)          # 140230916716520
id(b)          # 748527696

a   += (3,)    # (1, 2, 3)
b   += [3]     # [1, 2, 3]

id(a)          # 140230916878160
id(b)          # 748527696

Usage
As a list is mutable, it can't be used as a key in a dictionary, whereas a tuple can be used.
a    = (1,2)
b    = [1,2] 

c = {a: 1}     # OK
c = {b: 1}     # Error

188,1043339,17680413,Get visitors language & country code with javascript (client-side) [duplicate],"



Question: Is there a javascript (client-side) code to get visitors country/language code, that is accurate and is cross-""modern""-browser ? I am looking for results like 'en-US', 'sv-SE', 'nl-NL', etc.
Related questions to this have been asked before (some SO links: 1,2,3,4, among others) but I didn't find answer and some of the answers  are some yearls old and in some cases referring to even more old articles, which makes me think there are new solutions for this.
I tried :
var language = window.navigator.userLanguage || window.navigator.language;
console.log(language);

and got ""sv"" in Chrome and ""en-GB"" in Firefox, in the same machine, same place.
","62,979",36,17,javascript localization geolocation country-codes ,https://stackoverflow.com/questions/17680413/get-visitors-language-country-code-with-javascript-client-side,3,"
navigator.language isn't reliable as one of your linked questions states.
The reason this is asked a lot, but you're still searching says something about the problem. That language detection purely on the client side is not anything close to reliable.
First of all language preferences should only be used to detect language preferences - i.e. not location. My browser is set to en_US, because I wanted the English version. But I'm in the UK, so would have to alter this to en_GB to have my country detected via my browser settings. As the 'customer' that's not my problem. That's fine for language, but no good if all the prices on your site are in $USD.
To detect language you really do need access to a server side script. If you're not a back end dev and want to do as much as possible on the client side (as your question), all you need is a one line PHP script that echos back the Accept-Language header. At its simplest it could just be:
<?php
echo $_SERVER['HTTP_ACCEPT_LANGUAGE']; 
// e.g. ""en-US,en;q=0.8""

You could get this via Ajax and parse the text response client side, e.g (using jQuery):
$.ajax( { url: 'script.php', success: function(raw){
    var prefs = raw.split(',');
    // process language codes ....
} } );

If you were able to generate your HTML via a back end, you could avoid using Ajax completely by simply printing the language preferences into your page, e.g.
<script>
    var prefs = <?php echo json_encode($_SERVER['HTTP_ACCEPT_LANGUAGE'])?>;
</script>

If you had no access to the server but could get a script onto another server, a simple JSONP service would look like:
<?php
$prefs = $_SERVER['HTTP_ACCEPT_LANGUAGE'];
$jsonp = 'myCallback('.json_encode($prefs).')';

header('Content-Type: application/json; charset=UTF-8', true );
header('Content-Length: '.strlen($jsonp), true );
echo $jsonp;

Using jQuery for your Ajax you'd do something like:
function myCallback( raw ){
    var prefs = raw.split(',');
    // process language codes ....
}
$.ajax( {
    url: 'http://some.domain/script.php',
    dataType: 'jsonp'
} );

Country detection is another matter. On the client side there is navigator.geolocation, but it will most likely prompt your user for permission, so no good for a seamless user experience.
To do invisibly, you're limited to geo IP detection. By the same token as above, don't use language to imply country either.
To do country detection on the client side, you'll also need a back end service in order to get the client IP address and access a database of IP/location mappings. Maxmind's GeoIP2 JavaScript client appears to wrap this all up in a client-side bundle for you, so you won't need your own server (although I'm sure it will use a remote jsonp service). There's also freegeoip.net, which is probably less hassle than MaxMind in terms of signing up, and it appears to be open source too.

Using jQuery, this line will display your user's country code.

I want to create a div that can change its width/height as the window's width changes.

I know I can do this via JavaScript, but I would prefer using only CSS.

Just create a wrapper <div> with a percentage value for padding-bottom, like this:


.demoWrapper {
  padding: 10px;
  background: white;
  box-sizing: border-box;
  resize: horizontal;
  border: 1px dashed;
  overflow: auto;
  max-width: 100%;
  height: calc(100vh - 16px);
}

div {
  width: 100%;
  padding-bottom: 75%;
  background: gold; /** <-- For the demo **/
}
<div class=""demoWrapper"">
  <div></div>
</div>



It will result in a <div> with height equal to 75% of the width of its container (a 4:3 aspect ratio).
This relies on the fact that for padding :

The percentage is calculated with respect to the width of the generated box's containing block [...]  (source: w3.org, emphasis mine)

Padding-bottom values for other aspect ratios and 100% width :
aspect ratio  | padding-bottom value
--------------|----------------------
    16:9      |       56.25%
    4:3       |       75%
    3:2       |       66.66%
    8:5       |       62.5%


Placing content in the div :
In order to keep the aspect ratio of the div and prevent its content from stretching it, you need to add an absolutely positioned child and stretch it to the edges of the wrapper with:
div.stretchy-wrapper {
  position: relative;
}

div.stretchy-wrapper > div {
  position: absolute;
  top: 0; bottom: 0; left: 0; right: 0;
}

Here's a demo and another more in depth demo
",1403,"
vw units:
You can use vw units for both the width and height of the element. This allows the element's aspect ratio to be preserved, based on the viewport width.

vw : 1/100th of the width of the viewport.  [MDN]

Alternatively, you can also use vh for viewport height, or even vmin/vmax to use the lesser/greater of the viewport dimensions (discussion here).
Example: 1:1 aspect ratio


div {
  width: 20vw;
  height: 20vw;
  background: gold;
}
<div></div>



For other aspect ratios, you can use the following table to calculate the value for height according to the width of the element :
aspect ratio  |  multiply width by
-----------------------------------
     1:1      |         1
     1:3      |         3
     4:3      |        0.75
    16:9      |       0.5625

Example: 4x4 grid of square divs


body {
  display: flex;
  flex-wrap: wrap;
  justify-content: space-between;
}
div {
  width: 23vw;
  height: 23vw;

If you write some simple code using jagged and multidimensional arrays and then inspect the compiled assembly with an IL disassembler you will see that the storage and retrieval from jagged (or single dimensional) arrays are simple IL instructions while the same operations for multidimensional arrays are method invocations which are always slower.
Consider the following methods:
static void SetElementAt(int[][] array, int i, int j, int value)
{
    array[i][j] = value;
}

static void SetElementAt(int[,] array, int i, int j, int value)
{
    array[i, j] = value;
}

Their IL will be the following:

When using jagged arrays you can easily perform such operations as row swap and row resize. Maybe in some cases usage of multidimensional arrays will be more safe, but even Microsoft FxCop tells that jagged arrays should be used instead of multidimensional when you use it to analyse your projects.
",338,"
A multidimensional array creates a nice linear memory layout while a jagged array implies several extra levels of indirection.
Looking up the value jagged[3][6] in a jagged array var jagged = new int[10][5] works like this: Look up the element at index 3 (which is an array) and look up the element at index 6 in that array (which is a value). For each dimension in this case, there's an additional look up (this is an expensive memory access pattern).
A multidimensional array is laid out linearly in memory, the actual value is found by multiplying together the indexes. However, given the array var mult = new int[10,30], the Length property of that multidimensional array returns the total number of elements i.e. 10 * 30 = 300.
The Rank property of a jagged array is always 1, but a multidimensional array can have any rank. The GetLength method of any array can be used to get the length of each dimension. For the multidimensional array in this example mult.GetLength(1) returns 30.
Indexing the multidimensional array is faster. e.g. given the multidimensional array in this example mult[1,7] = 30 * 1 + 7 = 37, get the element at that index 37. This is a better memory access pattern because only one memory location is involved, which is the base address of the array.
A multidimensional array therefore allocates a continuous memory block, while a jagged array does not have to be square, e.g. jagged[1].Length does not have to equal jagged[2].Length, which would be true for any multidimensional array.
Performance
Performance wise, multidimensional arrays should be faster. A lot faster, but due to a really bad CLR implementation they are not.

The first row are timings of jagged arrays, the second shows multidimensional arrays and the third, well that's how it should be. The program is shown below, FYI this was tested running mono. (The windows timings are vastly different, mostly due to the CLR implementation variations).
On windows, the timings of the jagged arrays are greatly superior, about the same as my own interpretation of what multidimensional array look up should be like, see 'Single()'. Sadly the windows JIT-compiler is really stupid, and this unfortunately makes these performance discussions difficult, there are too many inconsistencies.
These are the timings I got on windows, same deal here, the first row are jagged arrays, second multidimensional and third my own implementation of multidimensional, note how much slower this is on windows compared to mono.

194,24403732,11743392,Check if an array is empty or exists,"
When the page is loading for the first time, I need to check if there is an image in image_array and load the last image.
Otherwise, I disable the preview buttons, alert the user to push new image button and create an empty array to put the images;
The problem is that image_array in the else fires all time. If an array exists - it just overrides it, but alert doesn't work.
if(image_array.length > 0)
    $('#images').append('<img src=""'+image_array[image_array.length-1]+'"" class=""images"" id=""1"" />');
else{
    $('#prev_image').attr('disabled', 'true');
    $('#next_image').attr('disabled', 'true');
    alert('Please get new image');
    var image_array = [];
}

UPDATE
Before loading html, I have something like this:
<?php if(count($images) != 0): ?>
<script type=""text/javascript"">
    <?php echo ""image_array = "".json_encode($images);?>
</script>
<?php endif; ?>

Your problem may be happening due to a mix of implicit global variables and variable hoisting. Make sure you use var whenever declaring a variable:
<?php echo ""var image_array = "".json_encode($images);?>
// add var  ^^^ here

And then make sure you never accidently redeclare that variable later:
else {
    ...
    image_array = []; // no var here
}

To check if an array is either empty or not
A modern way, ES5+:
if (Array.isArray(array) && array.length) {
    // array exists and is not empty
}

An old-school way:
typeof array != ""undefined""
    && array != null
    && array.length != null
    && array.length > 0

A compact way:
if (typeof array != ""undefined"" && array != null && array.length != null && array.length > 0) {
    // array exists and is not empty
}

A CoffeeScript way:
if array?.length > 0


Why?
Case Undefined
Undefined variable is a variable that you haven't assigned anything to it yet.
let array = new Array();     // ""array"" !== ""array""
typeof array == ""undefined""; // => true

Case Null
Generally speaking, null is state of lacking a value. For example a variable is null when you missed or failed to retrieve some data.
array = searchData();  // can't find anything
array == null;         // => true

Case Not an Array
Javascript has a dynamic type system. This means we can't guarantee what type of object a variable holds. There is a chance that we're not talking to an instance of Array.
supposedToBeArray =  new SomeObject();
typeof supposedToBeArray.length;       // => ""undefined""

array = new Array();
typeof array.length;                   // => ""number""

Case Empty Array
Now since we tested all other possibilities, we're talking to an instance of Array. In order to make sure it's not empty, we ask about number of elements it's holding, and making sure it has more than zero elements.
firstArray = [];
firstArray.length > 0;  // => false

secondArray = [1,2,3];
secondArray.length > 0; // => true

The short: is there a way to have a git repo push to and pull from a list of remote repos (rather than a single ""origin"")?
The long: I often have a situation when I'm developing an app in multiple computers, with different connectivity – say a laptop while on transit, a computer ""A"" while I'm in a certain location, and another computer ""B"" while on another. Also, the laptop might have connectivity with only either ""A"" or ""B"", and sometimes both.
What I would like to is for git to always ""pull"" from and ""push"" to all the computers it can currently connect to, so it's easier to jump from one machine to the other and continue working seamlessly.
","331,720",752,472,git ,https://stackoverflow.com/questions/849308/pull-push-from-multiple-remote-locations,15,"
You can configure multiple remote repositories with the git remote command:
git remote add alt alt-machine:/path/to/repo

To fetch from all the configured remotes and update tracking branches, but not merge into HEAD, do:
git remote update

If it's not currently connected to one of the remotes, it will take time out or throw an error, and go on to the next. You'll have to manually merge from the fetched repositories, or cherry-pick, depending on how you want to organize collecting changes.
To fetch the master branch from alt and pull it into your current head, do:
git pull alt master

So in fact git pull is almost shorthand for git pull origin HEAD (actually it looks in the config file to determine this, but you get the idea).
For pushing updates, you have to do that to each repo manually.
A push was, I think, designed with the central-repository workflow in mind.

Doing this manually is no longer necessary, with modern versions of git! See Malvineous's solution, below.

git remote set-url origin --push --add <a remote>

Original answer:
This something I’ve been using for quite a while without bad consequences and suggested by Linus Torvalds on the git mailing list.
araqnid’s solution is the proper one for bringing code into your repository… but when you, like me, have multiple equivalent authoritative upstreams (I keep some of my more critical projects cloned to both a private upstream, GitHub, and Codaset), it can be a pain to push changes to each one, every day.
Long story short, git remote add all of your remotes individually… and then git config -e and add a merged‐remote. Assuming you have this repository config:
[remote ""GitHub""]
    url = git@github.com:elliottcable/Paws.o.git
    fetch = +refs/heads/*:refs/remotes/GitHub/*
[branch ""Master""]
    remote = GitHub
    merge = refs/heads/Master
[remote ""Codaset""]
    url = git@codaset.com:elliottcable/paws-o.git
    fetch = +refs/heads/*:refs/remotes/Codaset/*
[remote ""Paws""]
    url = git@github.com:Paws/Paws.o.git
    fetch = +refs/heads/*:refs/remotes/Paws/*

… to create a merged‐remote for ""Paws"" and ""Codaset"", I can add the following after all of those:
[remote ""Origin""]
    url = git@github.com:Paws/Paws.o.git
    url = git@codaset.com:elliottcable/paws-o.git

Once I’ve done this, when I git push Origin Master, it will push to both Paws/Master and Codaset/Master sequentially, making life a little easier.

197,15617164,8081701,I keep getting “Uncaught SyntaxError: Unexpected token o”,"
I'm trying to learn some html/css/javascript, so I'm writing myself a teaching project.
The idea was to have some vocabulary contained in a json file which would then be loaded into a table. I managed to load the file in and print out one of its values, after which I began writing the code to load the values into the table.
After doing that I started getting an error, so I removed all the code I had written, leaving me with only one line (the same line that had worked before) ... only the error is still there.
The error is as follows:
Uncaught SyntaxError: Unexpected token o

jQuery.Callbacks.self.fireWithjquery-1.7.js:1182

jQuery.ajaxTransport.send.callback

My javascript code is contained in a separate file and is simply this:
function loadPageIntoDiv(){
    document.getElementById(""wokabWeeks"").style.display = ""block"";
}

function loadWokab(){
    //also tried getJSON which threw the same error
    jQuery.get('wokab.json', function(data) {
        var glacier = JSON.parse(data);
    });
}

And my JSON file just has the following right now:
[
    {
        ""english"": ""bag"",
        ""kana"": ""kaban"",
        ""kanji"": ""K""
    },

    {
        ""english"": ""glasses"",
        ""kana"": ""megane"",
        ""kanji"": ""M""
    }
]

Now the error is reported in line 11 which is the var glacier = JSON.parse(data); line.
When I remove the json file I get the error: ""GET http://.../wokab.json 404 (Not Found)"" so I know it's loading it (or at least trying to).

Looks like jQuery takes a guess about the datatype. It does the JSON parsing even though you're not calling getJSON()-- then when you try to call JSON.parse() on an object, you're getting the error.
Further explanation can be found in Aditya Mittal's answer.
",315,"
The problem is very simple
jQuery.get('wokab.json', function(data) {
    var glacier = JSON.parse(data);

You're parsing it twice. get uses the dataType='json', so data is already in json format.
Use $.ajax({ dataType: 'json' ... to specifically set the returned data type!

198,14219092,39527571,Are shell scripts sensitive to encoding and line endings?,"
I am making a NW.js app on Mac, and want to run the app in dev mode by double-clicking on an icon. First step, I'm trying to make my shell script work.
Using VSCode on Windows (I wanted to gain time), I have created a run-nw file at the root of my project, containing this:
#!/bin/bash

cd ""src""
npm install

cd ..
./tools/nwjs-sdk-v0.17.3-osx-x64/nwjs.app/Contents/MacOS/nwjs ""src"" &

but I get this output:
$ sh ./run-nw

: command not found  
: No such file or directory  
: command not found  
: No such file or directory  

Usage: npm <command>

where <command> is one of:  (snip commands list)

(snip npm help)

npm@3.10.3 /usr/local/lib/node_modules/npm  
: command not found  
: No such file or directory  
: command not found

I really don't understand:

it seems that it takes empty lines as commands. In my editor (VSCode) I have tried to replace \r\n with \n (in case the \r creates problems) but it changes nothing.
it seems that it doesn't find the folders (with or without the dirname instruction), or maybe it doesn't know about the cd command ?
it seems that it doesn't understand the install argument to npm
the part that really weirds me out, is that it still runs the app (if I did a npm install manually)...

Not able to make it work properly, and suspecting something weird with the file itself, I created a new one directly on the Mac, using vim this time. I entered the exact same instructions, and... now it works without any issue.
A diff on the two files reveals exactly zero difference.
What can be the difference? What can make the first script not work? How can I find out?
Update
Following the accepted answer's recommandations, after the wrong line endings came back, I checked multiple things. It turns out that since I copied my ~/.gitconfig from my Windows machine, I had autocrlf=true, so every time I modified the bash file under Windows, it re-set the line endings to \r\n.
So, in addition to running dos2unix (which you will have to install using Homebrew on mac), if you're using Git, check your config.
","23,629",49,21,bash shell sh ,https://stackoverflow.com/questions/39527571/are-shell-scripts-sensitive-to-encoding-and-line-endings,8,"
Yes. Bash scripts are sensitive to line-endings, both in the script itself and in data it processes. They should have Unix-style line-endings, i.e., each line is terminated with a Line Feed character (decimal 10, hex 0A in ASCII).
DOS/Windows line endings in the script
With Windows or DOS-style line endings , each line is terminated with a Carriage Return followed by a Line Feed character. You can see this otherwise invisible character in the output of cat -v yourfile:
$ cat -v yourfile
#!/bin/bash^M
^M
cd ""src""^M
npm install^M
^M
cd ..^M
./tools/nwjs-sdk-v0.17.3-osx-x64/nwjs.app/Contents/MacOS/nwjs ""src"" &^M

In this case, the carriage return (^M in caret notation or \r in C escape notation) is not treated as whitespace.  Bash interprets the first line after the shebang (consisting of a single carriage return character) as the name of a command/program to run.

Since there is no command named ^M, it prints : command not found
Since there is no directory named ""src""^M (or src^M), it prints : No such file or directory
It passes install^M instead of install as an argument to npm which causes npm to complain.

DOS/Windows line endings in input data
Like above, if you have an input file with carriage returns:
hello^M
world^M

then it will look completely normal in editors and when writing it to screen, but tools may produce strange results. For example, grep will fail to find lines that are obviously there:
$ grep 'hello$' file.txt || grep -x ""hello"" file.txt
(no match because the line actually ends in ^M)

Appended text will instead overwrite the line because the carriage returns moves the cursor to the start of the line:
$ sed -e 's/$/!/' file.txt
!ello
!orld

String comparison will seem to fail, even though strings appear to be the same when writing to screen:
$ a=""hello""; read b < file.txt
$ if [[ ""$a"" = ""$b"" ]]
  then echo ""Variables are equal.""
  else echo ""Sorry, $a is not equal to $b""
  fi

Sorry, hello is not equal to hello

Solutions
The solution is to convert the file to use Unix-style line endings. There are a number of ways this can be accomplished:

This can be done using the dos2unix program:
dos2unix filename


Open the file in a capable text editor (Sublime, Notepad++, not Notepad) and configure it to save files with Unix line endings, e.g., with Vim, run the following command before (re)saving:
:set fileformat=unix


If you have a version of the sed utility that supports the -i or --in-place option, e.g., GNU sed, you could run the following command to strip trailing carriage returns:
sed -i 's/\r$//' filename

With other versions of sed, you could use output redirection to write to a new file. Be sure to use a different filename for the redirection target (it can be renamed later).
sed 's/\r$//' filename > filename.unix


Similarly, the tr translation filter can be used to delete unwanted characters from its input:
tr -d '\r' <filename >filename.unix



Cygwin Bash
With the Bash port for Cygwin, there’s a custom igncr option that can be set to ignore the Carriage Return in line endings (presumably because many of its users use native Windows programs to edit their text files).
This can be enabled for the current shell by running set -o igncr.
Setting this option applies only to the current shell process so it can be useful when sourcing files with extraneous carriage returns.  If you regularly encounter shell scripts with DOS line endings and want this option to be set permanently, you could set an environment variable called SHELLOPTS (all capital letters) to include igncr. This environment variable is used by Bash to set shell options when it starts (before reading any startup files).
Useful utilities
The file utility is useful for quickly seeing which line endings are used in a text file. Here’s what it prints for for each file type:

Unix line endings: Bourne-Again shell script, ASCII text executable
Mac line endings: Bourne-Again shell script, ASCII text executable, with CR line terminators
DOS line endings: Bourne-Again shell script, ASCII text executable, with CRLF line terminators

The GNU version of the cat utility has a -v, --show-nonprinting option that displays non-printing characters.
The dos2unix utility is specifically written for converting text files between Unix, Mac and DOS line endings.
Useful links
Wikipedia has an excellent article covering the many different ways of marking the end of a line of text, the history of such encodings and how newlines are treated in different operating systems, programming languages and Internet protocols (e.g., FTP).
Files with classic Mac OS line endings
With Classic Mac OS (pre-OS X), each line was terminated with a Carriage Return (decimal 13, hex 0D in ASCII). If a script file was saved with such line endings, Bash would only see one long line like so:
#!/bin/bash^M^Mcd ""src""^Mnpm install^M^Mcd ..^M./tools/nwjs-sdk-v0.17.3-osx-x64/nwjs.app/Contents/MacOS/nwjs ""src"" &^M

Since this single long line begins with an octothorpe (#), Bash treats the line (and the whole file) as a single comment.
Note: In 2001, Apple launched Mac OS X which was based on the BSD-derived NeXTSTEP operating system. As a result, OS X also uses Unix-style LF-only line endings and since then, text files terminated with a CR have become extremely rare. Nevertheless, I think it’s worthwhile to show how Bash would attempt to interpret such files.

On  JetBrains products (PyCharm, PHPStorm, IDEA, etc.),  you'll need to click  on CRLF/LF to toggle between the two types of line separators (\r\n and \n).

199,31875,6760685,Creating a singleton in Python,"
This question is not for the discussion of whether or not the singleton design pattern is desirable, is an anti-pattern, or for any religious wars, but to discuss how this pattern is best implemented in Python in such a way that is most pythonic. In this instance I define 'most pythonic' to mean that it follows the 'principle of least astonishment'.
I have multiple classes which would become singletons (my use-case is for a logger, but this is not important). I do not wish to clutter several classes with added gumph when I can simply inherit or decorate.
Best methods:

Method 1: A decorator
def singleton(class_):
    instances = {}
    def getinstance(*args, **kwargs):
        if class_ not in instances:
            instances[class_] = class_(*args, **kwargs)
        return instances[class_]
    return getinstance

@singleton
class MyClass(BaseClass):
    pass

Pros

Decorators are additive in a way that is often more intuitive than multiple inheritance.

Cons

While objects created using MyClass() would be true singleton objects, MyClass itself is a a function, not a class, so you cannot call class methods from it. Also for

x = MyClass();
y = MyClass();
t = type(n)();

then x == y but x != t && y != t

Method 2: A base class
class Singleton(object):
    _instance = None
    def __new__(class_, *args, **kwargs):
        if not isinstance(class_._instance, class_):
            class_._instance = object.__new__(class_, *args, **kwargs)
        return class_._instance

class MyClass(Singleton, BaseClass):
    pass

Pros

It's a true class

Cons

Multiple inheritance - eugh! __new__ could be overwritten during inheritance from a second base class? One has to think more than is necessary.


Method 3: A metaclass
class Singleton(type):
    _instances = {}
    def __call__(cls, *args, **kwargs):
        if cls not in cls._instances:
            cls._instances[cls] = super(Singleton, cls).__call__(*args, **kwargs)
        return cls._instances[cls]

#Python2
class MyClass(BaseClass):
    __metaclass__ = Singleton

#Python3
class MyClass(BaseClass, metaclass=Singleton):
    pass

Pros

It's a true class
Auto-magically covers inheritance
Uses __metaclass__ for its proper purpose (and made me aware of it)

Cons

Are there any?


Method 4: decorator returning a class with the same name
def singleton(class_):
    class class_w(class_):
        _instance = None
        def __new__(class_, *args, **kwargs):
            if class_w._instance is None:
                class_w._instance = super(class_w,
                                    class_).__new__(class_,
                                                    *args,
                                                    **kwargs)
                class_w._instance._sealed = False
            return class_w._instance
        def __init__(self, *args, **kwargs):
            if self._sealed:
                return
            super(class_w, self).__init__(*args, **kwargs)
            self._sealed = True
    class_w.__name__ = class_.__name__
    return class_w

@singleton
class MyClass(BaseClass):
    pass

Pros

It's a true class
Auto-magically covers inheritance

Cons

Is there not an overhead for creating each new class? Here we are creating two classes for each class we wish to make a singleton. While this is fine in my case, I worry that this might not scale. Of course there is a matter of debate as to whether it aught to be too easy to scale this pattern...
What is the point of the _sealed attribute
Can't call methods of the same name on base classes using super() because they will recurse. This means you can't customize __new__ and can't subclass a class that needs you to call up to __init__.


Method 5: a module
a module file singleton.py
Pros

Simple is better than complex

Cons

Not lazily instantianted

","363,218",1027,660,python singleton decorator base-class metaclass ,https://stackoverflow.com/questions/6760685/creating-a-singleton-in-python,25,"
Use a Metaclass
I would recommend Method #2, but you're better off using a metaclass than a base class. Here is a sample implementation:
class Singleton(type):
    _instances = {}
    def __call__(cls, *args, **kwargs):
        if cls not in cls._instances:
            cls._instances[cls] = super(Singleton, cls).__call__(*args, **kwargs)
        return cls._instances[cls]
        
class Logger(object):
    __metaclass__ = Singleton

Or in Python3
class Logger(metaclass=Singleton):
    pass

If you want to run __init__ every time the class is called, add
        else:
            cls._instances[cls].__init__(*args, **kwargs)

to the if statement in Singleton.__call__.
A few words about metaclasses. A metaclass is the class of a class; that is, a class is an instance of its metaclass. You find the metaclass of an object in Python with type(obj). Normal new-style classes are of type type. Logger in the code above will be of type class 'your_module.Singleton', just as the (only) instance of Logger will be of type class 'your_module.Logger'. When you call logger with Logger(), Python first asks the metaclass of Logger, Singleton, what to do, allowing instance creation to be pre-empted. This process is the same as Python asking a class what to do by calling __getattr__ when you reference one of it's attributes by doing myclass.attribute.
A metaclass essentially decides what the definition of a class means and how to implement that definition. See for example http://code.activestate.com/recipes/498149/, which essentially recreates C-style structs in Python using metaclasses. The thread What are some (concrete) use-cases for metaclasses? also provides some examples, they generally seem to be related to declarative programming, especially as used in ORMs.
In this situation, if you use your Method #2, and a subclass defines a __new__ method, it will be executed every time you call SubClassOfSingleton() -- because it is responsible for calling the method that returns the stored instance. With a metaclass, it will only be called once, when the only instance is created. You want to customize what it means to call the class, which is decided by it's type.
In general, it makes sense to use a metaclass to implement a singleton. A singleton is special because is created only once, and a metaclass is the way you customize the creation of a class. Using a metaclass gives you more control in case you need to customize the singleton class definitions in other ways.
Your singletons won't need multiple inheritance (because the metaclass is not a base class), but for subclasses of the created class that use multiple inheritance, you need to make sure the singleton class is the first / leftmost one with a metaclass that redefines __call__ This is very unlikely to be an issue. The instance dict is not in the instance's namespace so it won't accidentally overwrite it.
You will also hear that the singleton pattern violates the ""Single Responsibility Principle"" -- each class should do only one thing. That way you don't have to worry about messing up one thing the code does if you need to change another, because they are separate and encapsulated. The metaclass implementation passes this test. The metaclass is responsible for enforcing the pattern and the created class and subclasses need not be aware that they are singletons. Method #1 fails this test, as you noted with ""MyClass itself is a a function, not a class, so you cannot call class methods from it.""
Python 2 and 3 Compatible Version
Writing something that works in both Python2 and 3 requires using a slightly more complicated scheme. Since metaclasses are usually subclasses of type type, it's possible to use one to dynamically create an intermediary base class at run time with it as its metaclass and then use that as the baseclass of the public Singleton base class. It's harder to explain than to do, as illustrated next:
# works in Python 2 & 3
class _Singleton(type):
    """""" A metaclass that creates a Singleton base class when called. """"""
    _instances = {}
    def __call__(cls, *args, **kwargs):
        if cls not in cls._instances:
            cls._instances[cls] = super(_Singleton, cls).__call__(*args, **kwargs)
        return cls._instances[cls]

class Singleton(_Singleton('SingletonMeta', (object,), {})): pass

class Logger(Singleton):
    pass

An ironic aspect of this approach is that it's using subclassing to implement a metaclass. One possible advantage is that, unlike with a pure metaclass, isinstance(inst, Singleton) will return True.
Corrections
On another topic, you've probably already noticed this, but the base class implementation in your original post is wrong. _instances needs to be referenced on the class, you need to use super() or you're recursing, and __new__ is actually a static method that you have to pass the class to, not a class method, as the actual class hasn't been created yet when it is called. All of these things will be true for a metaclass implementation as well.
class Singleton(object):
  _instances = {}
  def __new__(class_, *args, **kwargs):
    if class_ not in class_._instances:
        class_._instances[class_] = super(Singleton, class_).__new__(class_, *args, **kwargs)
    return class_._instances[class_]

class MyClass(Singleton):
  pass

c = MyClass()

Decorator Returning A Class
I originally was writing a comment but it was too long, so I'll add this here. Method #4 is better than the other decorator version, but it's more code than needed for a singleton, and it's not as clear what it does.
The main problems stem from the class being it's own base class. First, isn't it weird to have a class be a subclass of a nearly identical class with the same name that exists only in its __class__ attribute? This also means that you can't define any methods that call the method of the same name on their base class with super() because they will recurse. This means your class can't customize __new__, and can't derive from any classes that need __init__ called on them.
When to use the singleton pattern
Your use case is one of the better examples of wanting to use a singleton. You say in one of the comments ""To me logging has always seemed a natural candidate for Singletons."" You're absolutely right.
When people say singletons are bad, the most common reason is they are implicit shared state. While with global variables and top-level module imports are explicit shared state, other objects that are passed around are generally instantiated. This is a good point, with two exceptions.
The first, and one that gets mentioned in various places, is when the singletons are constant. Use of global constants, especially enums, is widely accepted, and considered sane because no matter what, none of the users can mess them up for any other user. This is equally true for a constant singleton.
The second exception, which get mentioned less, is the opposite -- when the singleton is only a data sink, not a data source (directly or indirectly). This is why loggers feel like a ""natural"" use for singletons. As the various users are not changing the loggers in ways other users will care about, there is not really shared state. This negates the primary argument against the singleton pattern, and makes them a reasonable choice because of their ease of use for the task.
Here is a quote from http://googletesting.blogspot.com/2008/08/root-cause-of-singletons.html:

Now, there is one kind of Singleton which is OK. That is a singleton where all of the reachable objects are immutable. If all objects are immutable than Singleton has no global state, as everything is constant. But it is so easy to turn this kind of singleton into mutable one, it is very slippery slope. Therefore, I am against these Singletons too, not because they are bad, but because it is very easy for them to go bad. (As a side note Java enumeration are just these kind of singletons. As long as you don't put state into your enumeration you are OK, so please don't.)
The other kind of Singletons, which are semi-acceptable are those which don't effect the execution of your code, They have no ""side effects"". Logging is perfect example. It is loaded with Singletons and global state. It is acceptable (as in it will not hurt you) because your application does not behave any different whether or not a given logger is enabled. The information here flows one way: From your application into the logger. Even thought loggers are global state since no information flows from loggers into your application, loggers are acceptable. You should still inject your logger if you want your test to assert that something is getting logged, but in general Loggers are not harmful despite being full of state.

        line = line2.replace('</[1>', '')

    line2 = line.replace('<[*> ', '')
    line = line2.replace('</[*> ', '')
    line2 = line.replace('<[*>', '')
    line = line2.replace('</[*>', '')

This tested snippet should do it:
import re
line = re.sub(r""</?\[\d+>"", """", line)

Edit: Here's a commented version explaining how it works:
line = re.sub(r""""""
  (?x) # Use free-spacing mode.
  <    # Match a literal '<'
  /?   # Optionally match a '/'
  \[   # Match a literal '['
  \d+  # Match one or more digits
  >    # Match a literal '>'
  """""", """", line)

Regexes are fun! But I would strongly recommend spending an hour or two studying the basics. For starters, you need to learn which characters are special: ""metacharacters"" which need to be escaped (i.e. with a backslash placed in front - and the rules are different inside and outside character classes.) There is an excellent online tutorial at: www.regular-expressions.info. The time you spend there will pay for itself many times over. Happy regexing!

Suppose that I have this script

Is there any way to access to the $VAR by just executing export.bash without sourcing it?
","325,802",311,74,bash shell unix environment-variables ,https://stackoverflow.com/questions/16618071/can-i-export-a-variable-to-the-environment-from-a-bash-script-without-sourcing-i,7,"

Is there any way to access to the $VAR by just executing export.bash without sourcing it ?

Quick answer: No.
But there are several possible workarounds.
The most obvious one, which you've already mentioned, is to use source or . to execute the script in the context of the calling shell:
$ cat set-vars1.sh 
export FOO=BAR
$ . set-vars1.sh 
$ echo $FOO
BAR

Another way is to have the script, rather than setting an environment variable, print commands that will set the environment variable:
$ cat set-vars2.sh
#!/bin/bash
echo export FOO=BAR
$ eval ""$(./set-vars2.sh)""
$ echo ""$FOO""
BAR

A third approach is to have a script that sets your environment variable(s) internally and then invokes a specified command with that environment:
$ cat set-vars3.sh
#!/bin/bash
export FOO=BAR
exec ""$@""
$ ./set-vars3.sh printenv | grep FOO
FOO=BAR

This last approach can be quite useful, though it's inconvenient for interactive use since it doesn't give you the settings in your current shell (with all the other settings and history you've built up).
",347,"
In order to export out the VAR variable first the most logical and seems working way is to source the variable:
. ./export.bash

or 
source ./export.bash

Now when echoing from main shell it works
 echo $VAR
HELLO, VARABLE

We will now reset VAR
export VAR=""""
echo $VAR

Now we will execute a script to source the variable then unset it :
./test-export.sh 
HELLO, VARABLE
--
.

the code: cat test-export.sh 
    #!/bin/bash
    # Source env variable
    source ./export.bash

    # echo out the variable in test script
    echo $VAR

    # unset the variable 
    unset VAR
    # echo a few dotted lines
    echo ""---""
    # now return VAR which is blank
    echo $VAR

Here is one way 
PLEASE NOTE: The exports are limited to the script that execute the exports in your main console - so as far as a cron job I would add it like the console like below... for the command part still questionable: here is how you would run in from your shell:
On your command prompt (so long as the export.bash has multiple echo values)
IFS=$'\n'; for entries in $(./export.bash); do  export $entries;  done; ./v1.sh 
HELLO THERE
HI THERE

cat v1.sh 
#!/bin/bash
echo $VAR
echo $VAR1

Now so long as this is for your usage - you could make the variables available for your scripts at any time by doing a bash alias like this:
myvars ./v1.sh
HELLO THERE
HI THERE

echo $VAR

.

add this to your .bashrc
function myvars() { 
    IFS=$'\n'; 
    for entries in $(./export.bash); do  export $entries;  done; 

    ""$@""; 

    for entries in $(./export.bash); do variable=$(echo $entries|awk -F""="" '{print $1}'); unset $variable;
done

}

source your bashrc file and you can do like above any time ...
Anyhow back to the rest of it..
This has made it available globally then executed the script..
simply echo it out then run export on the echo !
cat export.bash 
#!/bin/bash
echo ""VAR=HELLO THERE""

Now within script or your console run:
 export ""$(./export.bash)""

Try:
echo $VAR
HELLO THERE

Multiple values so long as you know what you are expecting in another script using above method:
cat export.bash 
#!/bin/bash
echo ""VAR=HELLO THERE""
echo ""VAR1=HI THERE""

cat test-export.sh 
#!/bin/bash

IFS=$'\n'
for entries in $(./export.bash); do
   export $entries
done

echo ""round 1""
echo $VAR
echo $VAR1

for entries in $(./export.bash); do
     variable=$(echo $entries|awk -F""="" '{print $1}');
     unset $variable
done

echo ""round 2""
echo $VAR
echo $VAR1

Now the results
 ./test-export.sh 
round 1
HELLO THERE
HI THERE
round 2


.

and the final final update to auto assign read the VARIABLES:
./test-export.sh 
Round 0 - Export out then find variable name - 
Set current variable to the variable exported then echo its value
$VAR has value of HELLO THERE
$VAR1 has value of HI THERE
round 1 - we know what was exported and we will echo out known variables
HELLO THERE
HI THERE
Round 2 - We will just return the variable names and unset them 
round 3 - Now we get nothing back

The script:
cat test-export.sh 
#!/bin/bash

IFS=$'\n'
echo ""Round 0 - Export out then find variable name - ""
echo ""Set current variable to the variable exported then echo its value""
for entries in $(./export.bash); do
 variable=$(echo $entries|awk -F""="" '{print $1}');
 export $entries
 eval current_variable=\$$variable
 echo ""\$$variable has value of $current_variable""
done


echo ""round 1 - we know what was exported and we will echo out known variables""
echo $VAR
echo $VAR1

echo ""Round 2 - We will just return the variable names and unset them ""

I need to parse RFC 3339 strings like ""2008-09-03T20:56:35.450686Z"" into Python's datetime type.

The python-dateutil package can parse not only RFC 3339 datetime strings like the one in the question, but also other ISO 8601 date and time strings  that don't comply with RFC 3339 (such as ones with no UTC offset, or ones that represent only a date).
>>> import dateutil.parser
>>> dateutil.parser.isoparse('2008-09-03T20:56:35.450686Z') # RFC 3339 format
datetime.datetime(2008, 9, 3, 20, 56, 35, 450686, tzinfo=tzutc())

Note that dateutil.parser.isoparse is presumably stricter than the more hacky dateutil.parser.parse, but both of them are quite forgiving and will attempt to interpret the string that you pass in. If you want to eliminate the possibility of any misreads, you need to use something stricter than either of these functions.

","981,282",1610,1067,http caching https http-headers ,https://stackoverflow.com/questions/49547/how-do-we-control-web-page-caching-across-all-browsers,29,"
Introduction
The correct minimum set of headers that works across all mentioned clients (and proxies):
Cache-Control: no-cache, no-store, must-revalidate
Pragma: no-cache
Expires: 0

The Cache-Control is per the HTTP 1.1 spec for clients and proxies (and implicitly required by some clients next to Expires). The Pragma is per the HTTP 1.0 spec for prehistoric clients. The Expires is per the HTTP 1.0 and 1.1 specs for clients and proxies. In HTTP 1.1, the Cache-Control takes precedence over Expires, so it's after all for HTTP 1.0 proxies only.
If you don't care about IE6 and its broken caching when serving pages over HTTPS with only no-store, then you could omit Cache-Control: no-cache.
Cache-Control: no-store, must-revalidate
Pragma: no-cache
Expires: 0

If you don't care about IE6 nor HTTP 1.0 clients (HTTP 1.1 was introduced 1997), then you could omit Pragma.
Cache-Control: no-store, must-revalidate
Expires: 0

If you don't care about HTTP 1.0 proxies either, then you could omit Expires.
Cache-Control: no-store, must-revalidate

On the other hand, if the server auto-includes a valid Date header, then you could theoretically omit Cache-Control too and rely on Expires only.
Date: Wed, 24 Aug 2016 18:32:02 GMT
Expires: 0

But that may fail if e.g. the end-user manipulates the operating system date and the client software is relying on it.
Other Cache-Control parameters such as max-age are irrelevant if the abovementioned Cache-Control parameters are specified. The Last-Modified header as included in most other answers here is only interesting if you actually want to cache the request, so you don't need to specify it at all.
How to set it?
Using PHP:
header(""Cache-Control: no-cache, no-store, must-revalidate""); // HTTP 1.1.
header(""Pragma: no-cache""); // HTTP 1.0.
header(""Expires: 0""); // Proxies.

Using Java Servlet, or Node.js:
response.setHeader(""Cache-Control"", ""no-cache, no-store, must-revalidate""); // HTTP 1.1.
response.setHeader(""Pragma"", ""no-cache""); // HTTP 1.0.
response.setHeader(""Expires"", ""0""); // Proxies.

Using ASP.NET-MVC
Response.Cache.SetCacheability(HttpCacheability.NoCache);  // HTTP 1.1.
Response.Cache.AppendCacheExtension(""no-store, must-revalidate"");
Response.AppendHeader(""Pragma"", ""no-cache""); // HTTP 1.0.
Response.AppendHeader(""Expires"", ""0""); // Proxies.

Using ASP.NET Web API:
// `response` is an instance of System.Net.Http.HttpResponseMessage
response.Headers.CacheControl = new CacheControlHeaderValue
{
    NoCache = true,
    NoStore = true,
    MustRevalidate = true
};
response.Headers.Pragma.ParseAdd(""no-cache"");
// We can't use `response.Content.Headers.Expires` directly
// since it allows only `DateTimeOffset?` values.
response.Content?.Headers.TryAddWithoutValidation(""Expires"", 0.ToString()); 

Using ASP.NET:
Response.AppendHeader(""Cache-Control"", ""no-cache, no-store, must-revalidate""); // HTTP 1.1.
Response.AppendHeader(""Pragma"", ""no-cache""); // HTTP 1.0.
Response.AppendHeader(""Expires"", ""0""); // Proxies.

Using ASP.NET Core v3
// using Microsoft.Net.Http.Headers
Response.Headers[HeaderNames.CacheControl] = ""no-cache, no-store, must-revalidate"";
Response.Headers[HeaderNames.Expires] = ""0"";
Response.Headers[HeaderNames.Pragma] = ""no-cache"";

Using ASP:
Response.addHeader ""Cache-Control"", ""no-cache, no-store, must-revalidate"" ' HTTP 1.1.
Response.addHeader ""Pragma"", ""no-cache"" ' HTTP 1.0.
Response.addHeader ""Expires"", ""0"" ' Proxies.

Using Ruby on Rails, or Python/Flask:
headers[""Cache-Control""] = ""no-cache, no-store, must-revalidate"" # HTTP 1.1.
headers[""Pragma""] = ""no-cache"" # HTTP 1.0.
headers[""Expires""] = ""0"" # Proxies.

Using Python/Django:
response[""Cache-Control""] = ""no-cache, no-store, must-revalidate"" # HTTP 1.1.
response[""Pragma""] = ""no-cache"" # HTTP 1.0.
response[""Expires""] = ""0"" # Proxies.

Using Python/Pyramid:
request.response.headerlist.extend(
    (
        ('Cache-Control', 'no-cache, no-store, must-revalidate'),
        ('Pragma', 'no-cache'),
        ('Expires', '0')
    )
)

Using Go:
responseWriter.Header().Set(""Cache-Control"", ""no-cache, no-store, must-revalidate"") // HTTP 1.1.
responseWriter.Header().Set(""Pragma"", ""no-cache"") // HTTP 1.0.
responseWriter.Header().Set(""Expires"", ""0"") // Proxies.

Using Apache .htaccess file:
<IfModule mod_headers.c>
    Header set Cache-Control ""no-cache, no-store, must-revalidate""
    Header set Pragma ""no-cache""
    Header set Expires 0
</IfModule>

Using HTML:
<meta http-equiv=""Cache-Control"" content=""no-cache, no-store, must-revalidate"">
<meta http-equiv=""Pragma"" content=""no-cache"">
<meta http-equiv=""Expires"" content=""0"">

HTML meta tags vs HTTP response headers
Important to know is that when an HTML page is served over an HTTP connection, and a header is present in both the HTTP response headers and the HTML <meta http-equiv> tags, then the one specified in the HTTP response header will get precedence over the HTML meta tag. The HTML meta tag will only be used when the page is viewed from a local disk file system via a file:// URL. See also W3 HTML spec chapter 5.2.2. Take care with this when you don't specify them programmatically because the webserver can namely include some default values.
Generally, you'd better just not specify the HTML meta tags to avoid confusion by starters and rely on hard HTTP response headers. Moreover, specifically those <meta http-equiv> tags are invalid in HTML5. Only the http-equiv values listed in HTML5 specification are allowed.
Verifying the actual HTTP response headers
To verify the one and other, you can see/debug them in HTTP traffic monitor of webbrowser's developer toolset. You can get there by pressing F12 in Chrome/Firefox23+/IE9+, and then opening the ""Network"" or ""Net"" tab panel, and then clicking the HTTP request of interest to uncover all detail about the HTTP request and response. The below screenshot is from Chrome:

I want to set those headers on file downloads too
First of all, this question and answer are targeted on ""web pages"" (HTML pages), not ""file downloads"" (PDF, zip, Excel, etc). You'd better have them cached and make use of some file version identifier somewhere in URI path or querystring to force a redownload on a changed file. When applying those no-cache headers on file downloads anyway, then beware of the IE7/8 bug when serving a file download over HTTPS instead of HTTP. For detail, see IE cannot download foo.jsf. IE was not able to open this internet site. The requested site is either unavailable or cannot be found.
",2680,"
(hey, everyone: please don't just mindlessly copy&paste all headers you can find)
First of all, Back button history is not a cache:

The freshness model (Section 4.2) does not necessarily apply to history mechanisms. That is, a history mechanism can display a previous representation even if it has expired.

In the old HTTP spec the wording was even stronger, explicitly telling browsers to disregard cache directives for back button history.
Back is supposed to go back in time (to the time when the user was logged in). It does not navigate forward to a previously opened URL.
However, in practice, the cache can influence the back button, in very specific circumstances:

Page must be delivered over HTTPS, otherwise this cache-busting won't be reliable. Plus, if you're not using HTTPS, then your page is vulnerable to login stealing in many other ways.
You must send Cache-Control: no-store, must-revalidate (some browsers observe no-store and some observe must-revalidate)

You never need any of:

<meta> with cache headers — it doesn't work at all. Totally useless.
post-check/pre-check — it's IE-only directive that only applies to cachable resources.
Sending same header twice or in dozen parts. Some PHP snippets out there actually replace previous headers, resulting in only last one being sent.

If you want, you could add:

no-cache or max-age=0, which will make resource (URL) ""stale"" and require browsers to check with the server if there's a newer version (no-store already implies this even stronger).
Expires with a date in the past for HTTP/1.0 clients (although real HTTP/1.0-only clients are completely non-existent these days).

Less no longer evaluates expression inside calc by default since v3.00.

Original answer (Less v1.x...2.x):
Do this:
body { width: calc(~""100% - 250px - 1.5em""); }

In Less 1.4.0 we will have a strictMaths option which requires all Less calculations to be within brackets, so the calc will work ""out-of-the-box"". This is an option since it is a major breaking change. Early betas of 1.4.0 had this option on by default. The release version has it off by default.

TH borders problem fix
Since border cannot be painted properly on a translated TH element,
to recreate and render ""borders"" use the box-shadow property:
/* Borders (if you need them) */
.tableFixHead,
.tableFixHead td {
  box-shadow: inset 1px -1px #000;
}
.tableFixHead th {
  box-shadow: inset 1px 1px #000, 0 1px #000;
}



.tableFixHead          { overflow-y: auto; height: 100px; }
.tableFixHead thead th { position: sticky; top: 0; }

/* Just common table stuff. Really. */
table  { border-collapse: collapse; width: 100%; }
th, td { padding: 8px 16px; }
th     { background:#eee; }

/* Borders (if you need them) */
.tableFixHead,
.tableFixHead td {
  box-shadow: inset 1px -1px #000;
}
.tableFixHead th {
  box-shadow: inset 1px 1px #000, 0 1px #000;
}
<div class=""tableFixHead"">
  <table>
    <thead>

Fixed table head - using JS. (IE)
You can use a bit of JS and translateY the th elements
jQuery example


var $th = $('.tableFixHead').find('thead th')
$('.tableFixHead').on('scroll', function() {
  $th.css('transform', 'translateY('+ this.scrollTop +'px)');
});
.tableFixHead { overflow-y: auto; height: 100px; }

/* Just common table stuff. */
table  { border-collapse: collapse; width: 100%; }
th, td { padding: 8px 16px; }
th     { background:#eee; }
<div class=""tableFixHead"">
  <table>
    <thead>
      <tr><th>TH 1</th><th>TH 2</th></tr>
    </thead>
    <tbody>
      <tr><td>A1</td><td>A2</td></tr>
      <tr><td>B1</td><td>B2</td></tr>
      <tr><td>C1</td><td>C2</td></tr>
      <tr><td>D1</td><td>D2</td></tr>
      <tr><td>E1</td><td>E2</td></tr>
    </tbody>
  </table>
</div>

<script src=""https://code.jquery.com/jquery-3.1.0.js""></script>



Or plain ES6 if you prefer (no jQuery required):
// Fix table head
function tableFixHead (e) {
    const el = e.target,
          sT = el.scrollTop;
    el.querySelectorAll(""thead th"").forEach(th => 
      th.style.transform = `translateY(${sT}px)`
    );
}
document.querySelectorAll("".tableFixHead"").forEach(el => 
    el.addEventListener(""scroll"", tableFixHead)
);

206,13513932,325933,Determine Whether Two Date Ranges Overlap,"
Given two date ranges, what is the simplest or most efficient way to determine whether the two date ranges overlap?
As an example, suppose we have ranges denoted by DateTime variables StartDate1 to EndDate1 and StartDate2 to EndDate2.
","432,846",1305,673,datetime math language-agnostic ,https://stackoverflow.com/questions/325933/determine-whether-two-date-ranges-overlap,35,"
(StartA <= EndB)  and  (EndA >= StartB)
Proof:
Let ConditionA Mean that DateRange A Completely After DateRange B
_                        |---- DateRange A ------| 
|---Date Range B -----|                           _
  (True if StartA > EndB)   
Let ConditionB Mean that DateRange A is Completely Before DateRange B
|---- DateRange A -----|                       _ 
 _                          |---Date Range B ----|
 (True if EndA < StartB)  
Then Overlap exists if Neither A Nor B is true -
 (If one range is neither completely after the other,
   nor completely before the other, 
     then they must overlap.)
Now one of De Morgan's laws says that: 
Not (A Or B)  <=>  Not A And Not B
Which translates to: (StartA <= EndB)  and  (EndA >= StartB)

NOTE: This includes conditions where the edges overlap exactly.  If you wish to exclude that,
change the >= operators to >, and <=  to < 

NOTE2. Thanks to @Baodad, see this blog, the actual overlap is least of:
  { endA-startA, endA - startB, endB-startA, endB - startB }   
(StartA <= EndB)  and  (EndA >= StartB)
(StartA <= EndB)  and  (StartB <= EndA)

NOTE3. Thanks to @tomosius, a shorter version reads:
DateRangesOverlap = max(start1, start2) < min(end1, end2)
This is actually a syntactical shortcut for what is a longer implementation, which includes extra checks to verify that the start dates are on or before the endDates.  Deriving this from above: 
If start and end dates can be out of order, i.e., if it is possible that startA > endA or startB > endB, then you also have to check that they are in order, so that means you have to add two additional validity rules:
(StartA <= EndB) and (StartB <= EndA) and (StartA <= EndA) and (StartB <= EndB)
or:
(StartA <= EndB) and (StartA <= EndA) and (StartB <= EndA) and (StartB <= EndB)
or,
(StartA <= Min(EndA, EndB) and (StartB <= Min(EndA, EndB))
or:
(Max(StartA, StartB) <= Min(EndA, EndB) 
But to implement Min() and Max(), you have to code, (using C ternary for terseness),:
(StartA > StartB? Start A: StartB) <= (EndA < EndB? EndA: EndB) 
",2393,"
I believe that it is sufficient to say that the two ranges overlap if:
(StartDate1 <= EndDate2) and (StartDate2 <= EndDate1)

Folding has been rolled out and is now implemented since Visual Studio Code version 0.10.11. There are these keyboard shortcuts available:

Fold folds the innermost uncollapsed region at the cursor:

Ctrl + Shift + [ on Windows and Linux
⌥ + ⌘ + [ on macOS

Unfold unfolds the collapsed region at the cursor:

Ctrl + Shift + ] on Windows and Linux
⌥ + ⌘ + ] on macOS

Fold All folds all regions in the editor:

Ctrl + (K => 0) (zero) on Windows and Linux
⌘ + (K => 0) (zero) on macOS

Unfold All unfolds all regions in the editor:

Ctrl + (K => J) on Windows and Linux
⌘ + (K => J) on macOS

As of Visual Studio Code version 1.12.0, April 2017, see Basic Editing > Folding section in the docs.
The default keys are:

Unfold All: CTRL+K, CTRL+J
Fold Region: CTRL+K, CTRL+[
Unfold Region: CTRL+K, CTRL+]

Use Math.round(num * 100) / 100
Edit: to ensure things like 1.005 round correctly, we use 
Math.round((num + Number.EPSILON) * 100) / 100
",3773,"
If the value is a text type:
parseFloat(""123.456"").toFixed(2);

If the value is a number:
var numb = 123.23454;
numb = numb.toFixed(2);

There is a downside that values like 1.5 will give ""1.50"" as the output. A fix suggested by @minitech:
var numb = 1.5;
numb = +numb.toFixed(2);
// Note the plus sign that drops any ""extra"" zeroes at the end.
// It changes the result (which is a string) into a number again (think ""0 + foo""),
// which means that it uses only as many digits as necessary.

It seems like Math.round is a better solution. But it is not! In some cases it will NOT round correctly:
Math.round(1.005 * 1000)/1000 // Returns 1 instead of expected 1.01!

toFixed() will also NOT round correctly in some cases (tested in Chrome v.55.0.2883.87)!
Examples:
parseFloat(""1.555"").toFixed(2); // Returns 1.55 instead of 1.56.
parseFloat(""1.5550"").toFixed(2); // Returns 1.55 instead of 1.56.
// However, it will return correct result if you round 1.5551.
parseFloat(""1.5551"").toFixed(2); // Returns 1.56 as expected.

1.3555.toFixed(3) // Returns 1.355 instead of expected 1.356.
// However, it will return correct result if you round 1.35551.
1.35551.toFixed(2); // Returns 1.36 as expected.

I guess, this is because 1.555 is actually something like float 1.55499994 behind the scenes.
Solution 1 is to use a script with required rounding algorithm, for example:
function roundNumber(num, scale) {
  if(!("""" + num).includes(""e"")) {
    return +(Math.round(num + ""e+"" + scale)  + ""e-"" + scale);
  } else {
    var arr = ("""" + num).split(""e"");
    var sig = """"
    if(+arr[1] + scale > 0) {
      sig = ""+"";
    }
    return +(Math.round(+arr[0] + ""e"" + sig + (+arr[1] + scale)) + ""e-"" + scale);
  }
}

https://plnkr.co/edit/uau8BlS1cqbvWPCHJeOy?p=preview
NOTE: This is not a universal solution for everyone. There are several different rounding algorithms, your implementation can be different, depends on your requirements. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rounding
Solution 2 is to avoid front end calculations and pull rounded values from the backend server.
Edit: Another possible solution, which is not a bullet proof also.
Math.round((num + Number.EPSILON) * 100) / 100

In some cases, when you round number like 1.3549999999999998 it will return incorrect result. Should be 1.35 but result is 1.36.

I have a table with the following fields:

FROM jobs
GROUP BY site_id, company, title, location
HAVING count( * ) >1

After running this query, I can remove duplicates using a server side script.

","386,008",388,169,mysql sql duplicates ,https://stackoverflow.com/questions/3311903/remove-duplicate-rows-in-mysql,25,"
A really easy way to do this is to add a UNIQUE index on the 3 columns.  When you write the ALTER statement, include the IGNORE keyword.  Like so:
ALTER IGNORE TABLE jobs
ADD UNIQUE INDEX idx_name (site_id, title, company);

This will drop all the duplicate rows.  As an added benefit, future INSERTs that are duplicates will error out.  As always, you may want to take a backup before running something like this...
",613,"
If you don't want to alter the column properties, then you can use the query below.
Since you have a column which has unique IDs (e.g., auto_increment columns), you can use it to remove the duplicates:
DELETE `a`
FROM
    `jobs` AS `a`,
    `jobs` AS `b`
WHERE
    -- IMPORTANT: Ensures one version remains
    -- Change ""ID"" to your unique column's name
    `a`.`ID` < `b`.`ID`

    -- Any duplicates you want to check for
    AND (`a`.`title` = `b`.`title` OR `a`.`title` IS NULL AND `b`.`title` IS NULL)
    AND (`a`.`company` = `b`.`company` OR `a`.`company` IS NULL AND `b`.`company` IS NULL)
    AND (`a`.`site_id` = `b`.`site_id` OR `a`.`site_id` IS NULL AND `b`.`site_id` IS NULL);

In MySQL, you can simplify it even more with the NULL-safe equal operator (aka ""spaceship operator""):
DELETE `a`
FROM
    `jobs` AS `a`,
    `jobs` AS `b`
WHERE
    -- IMPORTANT: Ensures one version remains

I am looking for a way to pass a method by reference. I understand that Java does not pass methods as parameters, however, I would like to get an alternative. 
I've been told interfaces are the alternative to passing methods as parameters but I don't understand how an interface can act as a method by reference. If I understand correctly an interface is simply an abstract set of methods that are not defined. I don't want to send an interface that needs to be defined every time because several different methods could call the same method with the same parameters.
What I would like to accomplish is something similar to this:
public void setAllComponents(Component[] myComponentArray, Method myMethod) {
    for (Component leaf : myComponentArray) {
        if (leaf instanceof Container) { //recursive call if Container
            Container node = (Container) leaf;
            setAllComponents(node.getComponents(), myMethod);
        } //end if node
        myMethod(leaf);
    } //end looping through components
}

setAllComponents(this.getComponents(), changeColor());
setAllComponents(this.getComponents(), changeSize());

Edit: as Pete Kirkham points out, there's another way of doing this using a Visitor. The visitor approach is a little more involved - your nodes all need to be visitor-aware with an acceptVisitor() method - but if you need to traverse a more complex object graph then it's worth examining.
",239,"
In Java 8, you can now pass a method more easily using Lambda Expressions and Method References. First, some background: a functional interface is an interface that has one and only one abstract method, although it can contain any number of default methods (new in Java 8) and static methods. A lambda expression can quickly implement the abstract method, without all the unnecessary syntax needed if you don't use a lambda expression.
Without lambda expressions:
obj.aMethod(new AFunctionalInterface() {
    @Override
    public boolean anotherMethod(int i)
    {
        return i == 982
    }
});

With lambda expressions:
obj.aMethod(i -> i == 982);


Here is an excerpt from the Java tutorial on Lambda Expressions:

Syntax of Lambda Expressions
A lambda expression consists of the following:

A comma-separated list of formal parameters enclosed in parentheses. The CheckPerson.test method contains one parameter, p,
  which represents an instance of the Person class.Note: You
  can omit the data type of the parameters in a lambda expression. In
  addition, you can omit the parentheses if there is only one parameter.
  For example, the following lambda expression is also valid:
p -> p.getGender() == Person.Sex.MALE 
    && p.getAge() >= 18
    && p.getAge() <= 25

The arrow token, ->
A body, which consists of a single expression or a statement block. This example uses the following expression:
p.getGender() == Person.Sex.MALE 
    && p.getAge() >= 18
    && p.getAge() <= 25

If you specify a single expression, then the Java runtime evaluates the expression and then returns its value. Alternatively,
  you can use a return statement:
p -> {
    return p.getGender() == Person.Sex.MALE
        && p.getAge() >= 18
        && p.getAge() <= 25;
}

A return statement is not an expression; in a lambda expression, you must enclose statements in braces ({}). However, you do not have
  to enclose a void method invocation in braces. For example, the
  following is a valid lambda expression:
email -> System.out.println(email)


Note that a lambda expression looks a lot like a method declaration;
  you can consider lambda expressions as anonymous methods—methods
  without a name.


Here is how you can ""pass a method"" using a lambda expression:
interface I {
    public void myMethod(Component component);
}

class A {
    public void changeColor(Component component) {
        // code here
    }

    public void changeSize(Component component) {
        // code here
    }
}

class B {
    public void setAllComponents(Component[] myComponentArray, I myMethodsInterface) {
        for(Component leaf : myComponentArray) {
            if(leaf instanceof Container) { // recursive call if Container
                Container node = (Container)leaf;
                setAllComponents(node.getComponents(), myMethodInterface);
            } // end if node
            myMethodsInterface.myMethod(leaf);
        } // end looping through components
    }
}

class C {
    A a = new A();
    B b = new B();

    public C() {
        b.setAllComponents(this.getComponents(), component -> a.changeColor(component));
        b.setAllComponents(this.getComponents(), component -> a.changeSize(component));
    }
}

Class C can be shortened even a bit further by the use of method references like so:
class C {
    A a = new A();
    B b = new B();

    public C() {
        b.setAllComponents(this.getComponents(), a::changeColor);
        b.setAllComponents(this.getComponents(), a::changeSize);
    }
}

I have a local Git repository called 'skeleton' that I use for storing project skeletons. It has a few branches, for different kinds of projects:
casey@agave [~/Projects/skeleton] git branch

If I want to check out the master branch for a new project, I can do
casey@agave [~/Projects] git clone skeleton new
Initialized empty Git repository in /Users/casey/Projects/new/.git/

and everything is how I want it. Specifically, the new master branch points to the skeleton master branch, and I can push and pull to move around changes to the basic project setup.
What doesn't work, however, is if I want to clone another branch. I can't get it so that I only pull the branch I want, for instance the rails branch, and then the new repository has a master branch that pushes to and pulls from the skeleton repository's rails branch, by default.
Is there a good way to go about doing this? Or, maybe this isn't the way that Git wants me to structure things, and I'm certainly open to that. Perhaps I should have multiple repositories, with the Ruby on Rails skeleton repository tracking the master skeleton repository? And any individual project cloning the Ruby on Rails skeleton repository.

This is implicit when doing a shallow clone.
This makes git clone --depth 1 the easiest way to save bandwidth.

And since Git 1.9.0 (February 2014), shallow clones support data transfer (push/pull), so that option is even more useful now.

With Git 2.26 (Q1 2020), ""git clone --recurse-submodules --single-branch"" now uses the same single-branch option when cloning the submodules.
See commit 132f600, commit 4731957 (21 Feb 2020) by Emily Shaffer (nasamuffin).

clone: pass --single-branch during --recurse-submodules
Signed-off-by: Emily Shaffer
Acked-by: Jeff King
Previously, performing ""git clone --recurse-submodules --single-branch"" resulted in submodules cloning all branches even though the superproject cloned only one branch.
Pipe --single-branch through the submodule helper framework to make it to 'clone' later on.

",906,"
One way is to execute the following.
git clone user@git-server:project_name.git -b branch_name /your/folder

Where branch_name is the branch of your choice and ""/your/folder"" is the destination folder for that branch. It's true that this will bring other branches giving you the opportunity to merge back and forth. 
Update
Now, starting with Git 1.7.10, you can now do this
git clone user@git-server:project_name.git -b branch_name --single-branch /your/folder

217,6289474,728891,Correct way to define Python source code encoding,"
PEP 263 defines how to declare Python source code encoding.
Normally, the first 2 lines of a Python file should start with:
#!/usr/bin/python
# -*- coding: <encoding name> -*-

But I have seen a lot of files starting with:
#!/usr/bin/python
# -*- encoding: <encoding name> -*-

=> encoding instead of coding.
So what is the correct way of declaring the file encoding?
Is encoding permitted because the regex used is lazy? Or is it just another form of declaring the file encoding?
I'm asking this question because the PEP does not talk about encoding, it just talks about coding.
","82,520",167,44,python encoding ,https://stackoverflow.com/questions/728891/correct-way-to-define-python-source-code-encoding,6,"
Check the docs here: 
""If a comment in the first or second line of the Python script matches the regular expression coding[=:]\s*([-\w.]+), this comment is processed as an encoding declaration""
""The recommended forms of this expression are
# -*- coding: <encoding-name> -*-

which is recognized also by GNU Emacs, and
# vim:fileencoding=<encoding-name>

which is recognized by Bram Moolenaar’s VIM.""
So, you can put pretty much anything before the ""coding"" part, but stick to ""coding"" (with no prefix) if you want to be 100% python-docs-recommendation-compatible.
More specifically, you need to use whatever is recognized by Python and the specific editing software you use (if it needs/accepts anything at all). E.g. the coding form is recognized (out of the box) by GNU Emacs but not Vim (yes, without a universal agreement, it's essentially a turf war).

This always works for me:

However, this doesn't make PHP to show parse errors - the only way to show those errors is to modify your php.ini with this line:
display_errors = on

(if you don't have access to php.ini, then putting this line in .htaccess might work too):

",3264,"
You can't catch parse errors when enabling error output at runtime, because it parses the file before actually executing anything (and since it encounters an error during this, it won't execute anything). You'll need to change the actual server configuration so that display_errors is on and the approriate error_reporting level is used. If you don't have access to php.ini, you may be able to use .htaccess or similar, depending on the server.

Ensure you've the right Eclipse and Server
Ensure that you're using at least Eclipse IDE for Enterprise Java developers (with the Enterprise). It contains development tools to create dynamic web projects and easily integrate servletcontainers (those tools are part of Web Tools Platform, WTP). In case you already had Eclipse IDE for Java (without Enterprise), and manually installed some related plugins, then chances are that it wasn't done properly. You'd best trash it and grab the real Eclipse IDE for Enterprise Java one.
You also need to ensure that you already have a servletcontainer installed on your machine which implements at least the same Servlet API version as the servletcontainer in the production environment, for example Apache Tomcat, Oracle GlassFish, JBoss AS/WildFly, etc. Usually, just downloading the ZIP file and extracting it is sufficient. In case of Tomcat, do not download the EXE format, that's only for Windows based production environments. See also a.o. Several ports (8005, 8080, 8009) required by Tomcat Server at localhost are already in use.
A servletcontainer is a concrete implementation of the Servlet API. Note that the Java EE SDK download at Oracle.com basically contains GlassFish. So if you happen to already have downloaded Java EE SDK, then you basically already have GlassFish. Also note that for example GlassFish and JBoss AS/WildFly are more than just a servletcontainer, they also supports JSF, EJB, JPA and all other Java EE fanciness. See also a.o. What exactly is Java EE?

Integrate Server in Eclipse and associate it with Project
Once having installed both Eclipse for Enterprise Java and a servletcontainer on your machine, do the following steps in Eclipse:

Integrate servletcontainer in Eclipse
a. Via Servers view

Open the Servers view in the bottom box.

Rightclick there and choose New > Server.

Pick the appropriate servletcontainer make and version and walk through the wizard.



b. Or, via Eclipse preferences

Open Window > Preferences > Server > Runtime Environments.

You can Add, Edit and Remove servers here.




Associate server with project
a. In new project

Open the Project Navigator/Explorer on the left hand side.

Rightclick there and choose New > Project and then in menu Web > Dynamic Web Project.

In the wizard, set the Target Runtime to the integrated server.



b. Or, in existing project

Rightclick project and choose Properties.

In Targeted Runtimes section, select the integrated server.



Either way, Eclipse will then automatically take the servletcontainer's libraries in the build path. This way you'll be able to import and use the Servlet API.



Never carry around loose server-specific JAR files
You should in any case not have the need to fiddle around in the Build Path property of the project. You should above all never manually copy/download/move/include the individual servletcontainer-specific libraries like servlet-api.jar, jsp-api.jar, el-api.jar, j2ee.jar, javaee.jar, etc. It would only lead to future portability, compatibility, classpath and maintainability troubles, because your webapp would not work when it's deployed to a servletcontainer of a different make/version than where those libraries are originally obtained from.
In case you're using Maven, you need to make absolutely sure that servletcontainer-specific libraries which are already provided by the target runtime are marked as <scope>provided</scope>.
Here are some typical exceptions which you can get when you litter the /WEB-INF/lib or even /JRE/lib, /JRE/lib/ext, etc with servletcontainer-specific libraries in a careless attempt to fix the compilation errors:

222,574730,730764,How to properly ignore exceptions,"
When you just want to do a try-except without handling the exception, how do you do it in Python?
Is the following the right way to do it?
try:
    shutil.rmtree(path)
except:
    pass

","1,038,458",807,197,python exception try-except ,https://stackoverflow.com/questions/730764/how-to-properly-ignore-exceptions,11,"
try:
    doSomething()
except: 
    pass

or
try:
    doSomething()
except Exception: 
    pass

The difference is that the first one will also catch KeyboardInterrupt, SystemExit and stuff like that, which are derived directly from exceptions.BaseException, not exceptions.Exception.
See documentation for details:

try statement
exceptions

",1076,"
It's generally considered best-practice to only catch the errors you are interested in. In the case of shutil.rmtree it's probably OSError:
>>> shutil.rmtree(""/fake/dir"")
Traceback (most recent call last):
    [...]
OSError: [Errno 2] No such file or directory: '/fake/dir'

If you want to silently ignore that error, you would do:
try:
    shutil.rmtree(path)
except OSError:
    pass

Why? Say you (somehow) accidently pass the function an integer instead of a string, like:
shutil.rmtree(2)

It will give the error ""TypeError: coercing to Unicode: need string or buffer, int found"" - you probably don't want to ignore that, which can be difficult to debug.
If you definitely want to ignore all errors, catch Exception rather than a bare except: statement. Again, why?
Not specifying an exception catches every exception, including the SystemExit exception which for example sys.exit() uses:
>>> try:
...     sys.exit(1)
... except:
...     pass
... 
>>>

Compare this to the following, which correctly exits:
>>> try:
...     sys.exit(1)
... except Exception:
...     pass
... 
shell:~$ 

If you want to write ever better behaving code, the OSError exception can represent various errors, but in the example above we only want to ignore Errno 2, so we could be even more specific:
import errno

try:
    shutil.rmtree(path)
except OSError as e:
    if e.errno != errno.ENOENT:
        # ignore ""No such file or directory"", but re-raise other errors

but it does not work, I just want a:
if (version > 3.1.3) { }

How can I achieve this?
","479,134",861,417,ios objective-c ,https://stackoverflow.com/questions/3339722/how-to-check-ios-version,37,"
The quick answer …

As of Swift 2.0, you can use #available in an if or guard to protect code that should only be run on certain systems.
if #available(iOS 9, *) {}



In Objective-C, you need to check the system version and perform a comparison.
[[NSProcessInfo processInfo] operatingSystemVersion] in iOS 8 and above.
As of Xcode 9:
if (@available(iOS 9, *)) {}

The full answer …
In Objective-C, and Swift in rare cases, it's better to avoid relying on the operating system version as an indication of device or OS capabilities.  There is usually a more reliable method of checking whether a particular feature or class is available.
Checking for the presence of APIs:
For example, you can check if UIPopoverController is available on the current device using NSClassFromString:
if (NSClassFromString(@""UIPopoverController"")) {
    // Do something
}

For weakly linked classes, it is safe to message the class, directly. Notably, this works for frameworks that aren't explicitly linked as ""Required"". For missing classes, the expression evaluates to nil, failing the condition:
if ([LAContext class]) {
    // Do something
}

Some classes, like CLLocationManager and UIDevice, provide methods to check device capabilities:
if ([CLLocationManager headingAvailable]) {
    // Do something
}

Checking for the presence of symbols:
Very occasionally, you must check for the presence of a constant. This came up in iOS 8 with the introduction of UIApplicationOpenSettingsURLString, used to load Settings app via -openURL:. The value didn't exist prior to iOS 8. Passing nil to this API will crash, so you must take care to verify the existence of the constant first:
if (&UIApplicationOpenSettingsURLString != NULL) {
    [[UIApplication sharedApplication] openURL:[NSURL URLWithString:UIApplicationOpenSettingsURLString]];
}

Comparing against the operating system version:
Let's assume you're faced with the relatively rare need to check the operating system version. For projects targeting iOS 8 and above, NSProcessInfo includes a method for performing version comparisons with less chance of error:
- (BOOL)isOperatingSystemAtLeastVersion:(NSOperatingSystemVersion)version

Projects targeting older systems can use systemVersion on UIDevice. Apple uses it in their GLSprite sample code.
// A system version of 3.1 or greater is required to use CADisplayLink. The NSTimer
// class is used as fallback when it isn't available.
NSString *reqSysVer = @""3.1"";
NSString *currSysVer = [[UIDevice currentDevice] systemVersion];
if ([currSysVer compare:reqSysVer options:NSNumericSearch] != NSOrderedAscending) {
    displayLinkSupported = TRUE;
}

If for whatever reason you decide that systemVersion is what you want, make sure to treat it as an string or you risk truncating the patch revision number (eg. 3.1.2 -> 3.1).

The classic and portable (Bash pre-4) way is:

If your script already starts with #!/bin/sh (no matter if intended or not), then the Bash 4 solution, and in general any Bash-specific code, is not the way to go.

    key = i % 10
    d[key] = d.get(key, 0) + 1

d = defaultdict(int)

Other posibility is

if you have problems with some names you can also try raw string literals:
r'C:\mydir'

however best practice is to use the os.path module functions that always select the correct configuration for your OS:
os.path.join(mydir, myfile)

Here is a quick and dirty implementation of datediff, as a proof of concept to solve the problem as presented in the question. It relies on the fact that you can get the elapsed milliseconds between two dates by subtracting them, which coerces them into their primitive number value (milliseconds since the start of 1970). 


// new Date(""dateString"") is browser-dependent and discouraged, so we'll write
// a simple parse function for U.S. date format (which does no error checking)
function parseDate(str) {
    var mdy = str.split('/');
    return new Date(mdy[2], mdy[0]-1, mdy[1]);
}

function datediff(first, second) {
    // Take the difference between the dates and divide by milliseconds per day.
    // Round to nearest whole number to deal with DST.
    return Math.round((second-first)/(1000*60*60*24));
}

alert(datediff(parseDate(first.value), parseDate(second.value)));
<input id=""first"" value=""1/1/2000""/>
<input id=""second"" value=""1/1/2001""/>



You should be aware that the ""normal"" Date APIs (without ""UTC"" in the name) operate in the local timezone of the user's browser, so in general you could run into issues if your user is in a timezone that you don't expect, and your code will have to deal with Daylight Saving Time transitions. You should carefully read the documentation for the Date object and its methods, and for anything more complicated, strongly consider using a library that offers more safe and powerful APIs for date manipulation.

Numbers and Dates -- MDN JavaScript Guide
Date -- MDN JavaScript reference

Also, for illustration purposes, the snippet uses named access on the window object for brevity, but in production you should use standardized APIs like getElementById, or more likely, some UI framework.

As of this writing, only one of the other answers correctly handles DST (daylight saving time) transitions. Here are the results on a system located in California:

N = 86400000

Although Math.round returns the correct results, I think it's somewhat clunky. Instead, by explicitly accounting for changes to the UTC offset when DST begins or ends, we can use exact arithmetic:
function treatAsUTC(date) {
    var result = new Date(date);
    result.setMinutes(result.getMinutes() - result.getTimezoneOffset());
    return result;
}

function daysBetween(startDate, endDate) {
    var millisecondsPerDay = 24 * 60 * 60 * 1000;
    return (treatAsUTC(endDate) - treatAsUTC(startDate)) / millisecondsPerDay;
}

alert(daysBetween($('#first').val(), $('#second').val()));

Explanation
JavaScript date calculations are tricky because Date objects store times internally in UTC, not local time. For example, 3/10/2013 12:00 AM Pacific Standard Time (UTC-08:00) is stored as 3/10/2013 8:00 AM UTC, and 3/11/2013 12:00 AM Pacific Daylight Time (UTC-07:00) is stored as 3/11/2013 7:00 AM UTC. On this day, midnight to midnight local time is only 23 hours in UTC!
Although a day in local time can have more or less than 24 hours, a day in UTC is always exactly 24 hours.1 The daysBetween method shown above takes advantage of this fact by first calling treatAsUTC to adjust both local times to midnight UTC, before subtracting and dividing.

231,440739,1634268,Explain the encapsulated anonymous function syntax,"
Summary
Can you explain the reasoning behind the syntax for encapsulated anonymous functions in JavaScript? Why does this work: (function(){})(); but this doesn't: function(){}();?

What I know
In JavaScript, one creates a named function like this:
function twoPlusTwo(){
    alert(2 + 2);
}
twoPlusTwo();

You can also create an anonymous function and assign it to a variable:
var twoPlusTwo = function(){
    alert(2 + 2);
};
twoPlusTwo();

You can encapsulate a block of code by creating an anonymous function, then wrapping it in brackets and executing it immediately:
(function(){
    alert(2 + 2);
})();

This is useful when creating modularised scripts, to avoid cluttering up the current scope, or global scope, with potentially conflicting variables - as in the case of Greasemonkey scripts, jQuery plugins, etc.
Now, I understand why this works. The brackets enclose the contents and expose only the outcome (I'm sure there's a better way to describe that), such as with (2 + 2) === 4.

What I don't understand
But I don't understand why this does not work equally as well:
function(){
    alert(2 + 2);
}();

Can you explain that to me?
","73,816",377,289,javascript syntax anonymous-function ,https://stackoverflow.com/questions/1634268/explain-the-encapsulated-anonymous-function-syntax,10,"
It doesn't work because it is being parsed as a FunctionDeclaration, and the name identifier of function declarations is mandatory.
When you surround it with parentheses it is evaluated as a FunctionExpression, and function expressions can be named or not.
The grammar of a FunctionDeclaration looks like this:
function Identifier ( FormalParameterListopt ) { FunctionBody }

And FunctionExpressions:
function Identifieropt ( FormalParameterListopt ) { FunctionBody }

As you can see the Identifier (Identifieropt) token in FunctionExpression is optional, therefore we can have a function expression without a name defined:
(function () {
    alert(2 + 2);
}());

Or named function expression:
(function foo() {
    alert(2 + 2);
}());

The Parentheses (formally called the Grouping Operator) can surround only expressions, and a function expression is evaluated.
The two grammar productions can be ambiguous, and they can look exactly the same, for example:
function foo () {} // FunctionDeclaration

0,function foo () {} // FunctionExpression

The parser knows if it's a FunctionDeclaration or a FunctionExpression, depending on the context where it appears.
In the above example, the second one is an expression because the Comma operator can also handle only expressions.
On the other hand, FunctionDeclarations could actually appear only in what's called ""Program"" code, meaning code outside in the global scope, and inside the FunctionBody of other functions.
Functions inside blocks should be avoided, because they can lead an unpredictable behavior, e.g.:


if (true) {
  function foo() {
    alert('true');
  }
} else {
  function foo() {
    alert('false!');
  }
}

foo(); // true? false? why?



The above code should actually produce a SyntaxError, since a Block can only contain statements (and the ECMAScript Specification doesn't define any function statement), but most implementations are tolerant, and will simply take the second function, the one which alerts 'false!'.
The Mozilla implementations -Rhino, SpiderMonkey,- have a different behavior. Their grammar contains a non-standard Function Statement, meaning that the function will be evaluated at run-time, not at parse time, as it happens with FunctionDeclarations. In those implementations we will get the first function defined.

Functions can be declared in different ways, compare the following:
1- A function defined with the Function constructor assigned to the variable multiply:
var multiply = new Function(""x"", ""y"", ""return x * y;"");

2- A function declaration of a function named multiply:
function multiply(x, y) {
    return x * y;
}

3- A function expression assigned to the variable multiply:
var multiply = function (x, y) {
    return x * y;
};

4- A named function expression func_name, assigned to the variable multiply:
var multiply = function func_name(x, y) {
    return x * y;
};

",415,"
Even though this is an old question and answer, it discusses a topic that to this day throws many developers for a loop. I can't count the number of JavaScript developer candidates I've interviewed who couldn't tell me the difference between a function declaration and a function expression and who had no clue what an immediately invoked function expression is.
I'd like to mention, though, one very important thing which is that Premasagar's code snippet wouldn't work even if he had given it a name identifier.
function someName() {
    alert(2 + 2);
}();

The reason this wouldn't work is that the JavaScript engine interprets this as a function declaration followed by a completely unrelated grouping operator that contains no expression, and grouping operators must contain an expression. According to JavaScript, the above snippet of code is equivalent to the following one.
function someName() {
    alert(2 + 2);
}

();

Another thing I'd like to point out that may be of some use to some people is that any name identifier you provide for a function expression is pretty much useless in the context of the code except from within the function definition itself.
var a = function b() {
    // do something
};
a(); // works
b(); // doesn't work

var c = function d() {
    window.setTimeout(d, 1000); // works
};

Of course, using name identifiers with your function definitions is always helpful when it comes to debugging code, but that's something else entirely... :-)

The latest version of Cygwin seems to only support files in Unix format (i.e. with \n for newlines as opposed to the DOS/Windows \r\n newline).
To fix this, run the /bin/dos2unix.exe utility, giving your script as the argument to the command:
e.g. /bin/dos2unix.exe myScript.sh

This will convert it to Unix format and you then should be able to run it.

If you can't fix all your scripts, you should be able to modify the EOL behavior in Cygwin by setting an option to ignore CRs:

If you add this to your .bash_profile, it will be globally set by default when you login:
export SHELLOPTS
set -o igncr

You can also do this per script internally by putting this line just after the #! line:
(set -o igncr) 2>/dev/null && set -o igncr; # this comment is required

You need the comment to ignore the CR in that line which is read before the option takes effect.

You need to specify a Main-Class in the jar file manifest.
Oracle's tutorial contains a complete demonstration, but here's another one from scratch. You need two files:
Test.java:
public class Test
{
    public static void main(String[] args)
    {
        System.out.println(""Hello world"");
    }
}

manifest.mf:
Manifest-version: 1.0
Main-Class: Test

Note that the text file must end with a new line or carriage return.
The last line will not be parsed properly if it does not end with a
new line or carriage return.
Then run:
javac Test.java
jar cfm test.jar manifest.mf Test.class

To delete a key regardless of whether it is in the dictionary, use the two-argument form of dict.pop():
my_dict.pop('key', None)

This will return my_dict[key] if key exists in the dictionary, and None otherwise. If the second parameter is not specified (ie. my_dict.pop('key')) and key does not exist, a KeyError is raised.
To delete a key that is guaranteed to exist, you can also use
del my_dict['key']

This will raise a KeyError if the key is not in the dictionary.

Specifically to answer ""is there a one line way of doing this?""
if 'key' in my_dict: del my_dict['key']

...well, you asked ;-)
You should consider, though, that this way of deleting an object from a dict is not atomic—it is possible that 'key' may be in my_dict during the if statement, but may be deleted before del is executed, in which case del will fail with a KeyError.  Given this, it would be safest to either use dict.pop or something along the lines of
try:
    del my_dict['key']
except KeyError:
    pass

which, of course, is definitely not a one-liner.

As already suggested, use yourEnumerable.ToList(). It enumerates through your IEnumerable, storing the contents in a new List. You aren't necessarily copying an existing list, as your IEnumerable may be generating the elements lazily.

You must understand the difference between a class and an instance of that class. If you see a car on the street, you know immediately that it's a car even if you can't see which model or type. This is because you compare what you see with the class ""car"". The class contains which is similar to all cars. Think of it as a template or an idea.
At the same time, the car you see is an instance of the class ""car"" since it has all the properties which you expect: There is someone driving it, it has an engine, wheels.
So the class says ""all cars have a color"" and the instance says ""this specific car is red"".
In the OO world, you define the class and inside the class, you define a field of type Color. When the class is instantiated (when you create a specific instance), memory is reserved for the color and you can give this specific instance a color. Since these attributes are specific, they are non-static.
Static fields and methods are shared with all instances. They are for values which are specific to the class and not a specific instance. For methods, this usually are global helper methods (like Integer.parseInt()). For fields, it's usually constants (like car types, i.e. something where you have a limited set which doesn't change often).
To solve your problem, you need to instantiate an instance (create an object) of your class so the runtime can reserve memory for the instance (otherwise, different instances would overwrite each other which you don't want).
In your case, try this code as a starting block:
public static void main (String[] args)
{
    try
    {
        MyProgram7 obj = new MyProgram7 ();
        obj.run (args);
    }

    {
        e.printStackTrace ();
    }
}

// instance variables here

public void run (String[] args) throws Exception
{
    // put your code here
}

The new main() method creates an instance of the class it contains (sounds strange but since main() is created with the class instead of with the instance, it can do this) and then calls an instance method (run()).

I need a bit of help straightening out something, I know it's a very easy easy question but it's something that is slightly confusing me in SQL.
This SQL query throws a 'not a GROUP BY expression' error in Oracle. I understand why, as I know that once I group by an attribute of a tuple, I can no longer access any other attribute.
SELECT * 
FROM order_details 
GROUP BY order_no

However this one does work
SELECT SUM(order_price)
FROM order_details
GROUP BY order_no

Just to concrete my understanding on this.... Assuming that there are multiple tuples in order_details for each order that is made, once I group the tuples according to order_no, I can still access the order_price attribute for each individual tuple in the group, but only using an aggregate function?
In other words, aggregate functions when used in the SELECT clause are able to drill down into the group to see the 'hidden' attributes, where simply using 'SELECT order_no' will throw an error?
","41,827",44,14,sql oracle ,https://stackoverflow.com/questions/4611897/group-by-aggregate-function-confusion-in-sql,5,"
In standard SQL (but not MySQL), when you use GROUP BY, you must list all the result columns that are not aggregates in the GROUP BY clause.  So, if order_details has 6 columns, then you must list all 6 columns (by name - you can't use * in the GROUP BY or ORDER BY clauses) in the GROUP BY clause.
You can also do:
SELECT order_no, SUM(order_price)
  FROM order_details
 GROUP BY order_no;

That will work because all the non-aggregate columns are listed in the GROUP BY clause.
You could do something like:
SELECT order_no, order_price, MAX(order_item)
  FROM order_details
 GROUP BY order_no, order_price;

This query isn't really meaningful (or most probably isn't meaningful), but it will 'work'.  It will list each separate order number and order price combination, and will give the maximum order item (number) associated with that price.  If all the items in an order have distinct prices, you'll end up with groups of one row each.  OTOH, if there are several items in the order at the same price (say £0.99 each), then it will group those together and return the maximum order item number at that price.  (I'm assuming the table has a primary key on (order_no, order_item) where the first item in the order has order_item = 1, the second item is 2, etc.)
",50,"
SELECT * 
FROM order_details

In the above query you are selecting all the columns because of that its throwing an error not group by something like..
to avoid that you have to mention all the columns whichever in select statement all columns must be in group by clause..
 SELECT *

I'd like to compare two arrays... ideally, efficiently. Nothing fancy, just true if they are identical, and false if not. Not surprisingly, the comparison operator doesn't seem to work.
var a1 = [1,2,3];
var a2 = [1,2,3];
console.log(a1==a2);    // Returns false
console.log(JSON.stringify(a1)==JSON.stringify(a2));    // Returns true

","1,026,116",1061,313,javascript arrays json ,https://stackoverflow.com/questions/7837456/how-to-compare-arrays-in-javascript,65,"
To compare arrays, loop through them and compare every value:
Comparing arrays:
// Warn if overriding existing method
if(Array.prototype.equals)
    console.warn(""Overriding existing Array.prototype.equals. Possible causes: New API defines the method, there's a framework conflict or you've got double inclusions in your code."");
// attach the .equals method to Array's prototype to call it on any array
Array.prototype.equals = function (array) {
    // if the other array is a falsy value, return
    if (!array)
        return false;

    // compare lengths - can save a lot of time 
    if (this.length != array.length)
        return false;

    for (var i = 0, l=this.length; i < l; i++) {
        // Check if we have nested arrays
        if (this[i] instanceof Array && array[i] instanceof Array) {
            // recurse into the nested arrays
            if (!this[i].equals(array[i]))
                return false;       
        }           
        else if (this[i] != array[i]) { 
            // Warning - two different object instances will never be equal: {x:20} != {x:20}
            return false;   
        }           
    }       
    return true;
}
// Hide method from for-in loops
Object.defineProperty(Array.prototype, ""equals"", {enumerable: false});

Usage:
[1, 2, [3, 4]].equals([1, 2, [3, 2]]) === false;
[1, ""2,3""].equals([1, 2, 3]) === false;
[1, 2, [3, 4]].equals([1, 2, [3, 4]]) === true;
[1, 2, 1, 2].equals([1, 2, 1, 2]) === true;

You may say ""But it is much faster to compare strings - no loops..."" well, then you should note there ARE loops. First recursive loop that converts Array to string and second, that compares two strings. So this method is faster than use of string.
I believe that larger amounts of data should be always stored in arrays, not in objects. However if you use objects, they can be partially compared too.
Here's how:
Comparing objects:
I've stated above, that two object instances will never be equal, even if they contain same data at the moment:
({a:1, foo:""bar"", numberOfTheBeast: 666}) == ({a:1, foo:""bar"", numberOfTheBeast: 666})  //false

This has a reason, since there may be, for example private variables within objects.
However, if you just use object structure to contain data, comparing is still possible:
Object.prototype.equals = function(object2) {
    //For the first loop, we only check for types
    for (propName in this) {
        //Check for inherited methods and properties - like .equals itself
        //https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Object/hasOwnProperty
        //Return false if the return value is different
        if (this.hasOwnProperty(propName) != object2.hasOwnProperty(propName)) {
            return false;
        }
        //Check instance type
        else if (typeof this[propName] != typeof object2[propName]) {
            //Different types => not equal
            return false;
        }
    }
    //Now a deeper check using other objects property names
    for(propName in object2) {
        //We must check instances anyway, there may be a property that only exists in object2
            //I wonder, if remembering the checked values from the first loop would be faster or not 
        if (this.hasOwnProperty(propName) != object2.hasOwnProperty(propName)) {
            return false;
        }
        else if (typeof this[propName] != typeof object2[propName]) {
            return false;
        }
        //If the property is inherited, do not check any more (it must be equa if both objects inherit it)
        if(!this.hasOwnProperty(propName))
          continue;
        
        //Now the detail check and recursion
        
        //This returns the script back to the array comparing
        /**REQUIRES Array.equals**/
        if (this[propName] instanceof Array && object2[propName] instanceof Array) {
                   // recurse into the nested arrays
           if (!this[propName].equals(object2[propName]))
                        return false;
        }
        else if (this[propName] instanceof Object && object2[propName] instanceof Object) {
                   // recurse into another objects
                   //console.log(""Recursing to compare "", this[propName],""with"",object2[propName], "" both named \""""+propName+""\"""");
           if (!this[propName].equals(object2[propName]))
                        return false;
        }
        //Normal value comparison for strings and numbers
        else if(this[propName] != object2[propName]) {
           return false;
        }
    }
    //If everything passed, let's say YES
    return true;
}  

However, remember that this one is to serve in comparing JSON like data, not class instances and other stuff. If you want to compare mor complicated objects, look at this answer and it's superlong function.
To make this work with Array.equals you must edit the original function a little bit:
...
    // Check if we have nested arrays
    if (this[i] instanceof Array && array[i] instanceof Array) {
        // recurse into the nested arrays
        if (!this[i].equals(array[i]))
            return false;
    }
    /**REQUIRES OBJECT COMPARE**/
    else if (this[i] instanceof Object && array[i] instanceof Object) {
        // recurse into another objects
        //console.log(""Recursing to compare "", this[propName],""with"",object2[propName], "" both named \""""+propName+""\"""");
        if (!this[i].equals(array[i]))
            return false;
        }
    else if (this[i] != array[i]) {
...

I made a little test tool for both of the functions.
Bonus: Nested arrays with indexOf and contains
Samy Bencherif has prepared useful functions for the case you're searching for a specific object in nested arrays, which are available here: https://jsfiddle.net/SamyBencherif/8352y6yw/
",905,"
While this only works for scalar arrays (see note below), it is short:
array1.length === array2.length && array1.every(function(value, index) { return value === array2[index]})

Rr, in ECMAScript 6 / CoffeeScript / TypeScript with Arrow Functions:
array1.length === array2.length && array1.every((value, index) => value === array2[index])

(Note: 'scalar' here means values that can be compared directly using === . So: numbers, strings, objects by reference, functions by reference. See the MDN reference for more info about the comparison operators).

From what I read from the comments, sorting the array and comparing may give accurate result:
const array2Sorted = array2.slice().sort();
array1.length === array2.length && array1.slice().sort().every(function(value, index) {
    return value === array2Sorted[index];
});

Eg:
array1 = [2,3,1,4];
array2 = [1,2,3,4];

Then the above code would give true

Either:
public static string ByteArrayToString(byte[] ba)
{
  StringBuilder hex = new StringBuilder(ba.Length * 2);
  foreach (byte b in ba)
    hex.AppendFormat(""{0:x2}"", b);
  return hex.ToString();
}

or:
public static string ByteArrayToString(byte[] ba)
{
  return BitConverter.ToString(ba).Replace(""-"","""");
}

There are even more variants of doing it, for example here.
The reverse conversion would go like this:
public static byte[] StringToByteArray(String hex)
{
  int NumberChars = hex.Length;
  byte[] bytes = new byte[NumberChars / 2];
  for (int i = 0; i < NumberChars; i += 2)
    bytes[i / 2] = Convert.ToByte(hex.Substring(i, 2), 16);
  return bytes;
}


Using Substring is the best option in combination with Convert.ToByte. See this answer for more information. If you need better performance, you must avoid Convert.ToByte before you can drop SubString.

Performance Analysis
Note: new leader as of 2015-08-20.
I ran each of the various conversion methods through some crude Stopwatch performance testing, a run with a random sentence (n=61, 1000 iterations) and a run with a Project Gutenburg text (n=1,238,957, 150 iterations). Here are the results, roughly from fastest to slowest. All measurements are in ticks (10,000 ticks = 1 ms) and all relative notes are compared to the [slowest] StringBuilder implementation. For the code used, see below or the test framework repo where I now maintain the code for running this.
Disclaimer
WARNING: Do not rely on these stats for anything concrete; they are simply a sample run of sample data. If you really need top-notch performance, please test these methods in an environment representative of your production needs with data representative of what you will use.

Lookup tables have taken the lead over byte manipulation. Basically, there is some form of precomputing what any given nibble or byte will be in hex. Then, as you rip through the data, you simply look up the next portion to see what hex string it would be. That value is then added to the resulting string output in some fashion. For a long time byte manipulation, potentially harder to read by some developers, was the top-performing approach.
Your best bet is still going to be finding some representative data and trying it out in a production-like environment. If you have different memory constraints, you may prefer a method with fewer allocations to one that would be faster but consume more memory.
Testing Code
Feel free to play with the testing code I used. A version is included here but feel free to clone the repo and add your own methods. Please submit a pull request if you find anything interesting or want to help improve the testing framework it uses.

Add the new static method (Func<byte[], string>) to /Tests/ConvertByteArrayToHexString/Test.cs.
Add that method's name to the TestCandidates return value in that same class.
Make sure you are running the input version you want, sentence or text, by toggling the comments in GenerateTestInput in that same class.
Hit F5 and wait for the output (an HTML dump is also generated in the /bin folder).

Update (2012-02-05)
Test repo includes more variants such as StringBuilder.Append(b.ToString(""X2"")). None upset the results any. foreach is faster than {IEnumerable}.Aggregate, for instance, but BitConverter still wins.
Update (2012-04-03)
Added Mykroft's SoapHexBinary answer to analysis, which took over third place.
Update (2013-01-15)
Added CodesInChaos's byte manipulation answer, which took over first place (by a large margin on large blocks of text).
Update (2013-05-23)
Added Nathan Moinvaziri's lookup answer and the variant from Brian Lambert's blog. Both rather fast, but not taking the lead on the test machine I used (AMD Phenom 9750).
Update (2014-07-31)
Added @CodesInChaos's new byte-based lookup answer. It appears to have taken the lead on both the sentence tests and the full-text tests.
Update (2015-08-20)
Added airbreather's optimizations and unsafe variant to this answer's repo. If you want to play in the unsafe game, you can get some huge performance gains over any of the prior top winners on both short strings and large texts.

I've tried to find a comprehensive guide on whether it is best to use import module or from module import. I've just started with Python and I'm trying to start off with best practices in mind.
Basically, I was hoping if anyone could share their experiences, what preferences other developers have and what's the best way to avoid any gotchas down the road?
","161,657",433,190,python python-import ,https://stackoverflow.com/questions/710551/use-import-module-or-from-module-import,19,"
The difference between import module and from module import foo is mainly subjective.  Pick the one you like best and be consistent in your use of it.  Here are some points to help you decide.
import module

Pros:

Less maintenance of your import statements. Don't need to add any additional imports to start using another item from the module

Cons:

Typing module.foo in your code can be tedious and redundant (tedium can be minimized by using import module as mo then typing mo.foo)


from module import foo

Pros:

Less typing to use foo
More control over which items of a module can be accessed

Cons:

To use a new item from the module you have to update your import statement
You lose context about foo. For example, it's less clear what ceil() does compared to math.ceil()


Either method is acceptable, but don't use from module import *.  
For any reasonable large set of code, if you import * you will likely be cementing it into the module, unable to be removed.  This is because it is difficult to determine what items used in the code are coming from 'module', making it easy to get to the point where you think you don't use the import any more but it's extremely difficult to be sure.
",490,"
There's another detail here, not mentioned, related to writing to a module. Granted this may not be very common, but I've needed it from time to time.
Due to the way references and name binding works in Python, if you want to update some symbol in a module, say foo.bar, from outside that module, and have other importing code ""see"" that change, you have to import foo a certain way. For example:
module foo:
bar = ""apples""

module a:
import foo
foo.bar = ""oranges""   # update bar inside foo module object

module b:
import foo           
print foo.bar        # if executed after a's ""foo.bar"" assignment, will print ""oranges""

However, if you import symbol names instead of module names, this will not work.
For example, if I do this in module a:
from foo import bar
bar = ""oranges""

No code outside of a will see bar as ""oranges"" because my setting of bar merely affected the name ""bar"" inside module a, it did not ""reach into"" the foo module object and update its ""bar"".

Nothing an author can do can choose to open in a new tab instead of a new window; it is a user preference. (Note that the default user preference in most browsers is for new tabs, so a trivial test on a browser where that preference hasn't been changed will not demonstrate this.)
CSS3 proposed target-new, but the specification was abandoned.
The reverse is not true; by specifying dimensions for the window in the third argument of window.open(), you can trigger a new window when the preference is for tabs.

This is a trick,  
function openInNewTab(url) {

In most cases, this should happen directly in the onclick handler for the link to prevent pop-up blockers, and the default ""new window"" behavior. You could do it this way, or by adding an event listener to your DOM object.

Is there a plugin-less way of retrieving query string values via jQuery (or without)? 
If so, how? If not, is there a plugin which can do so?
","3,946,660",2696,2048,javascript url plugins query-string ,https://stackoverflow.com/questions/901115/how-can-i-get-query-string-values-in-javascript,73,"
Update: Sep-2018
You can use URLSearchParams which is simple and has decent (but not complete) browser support.
const urlParams = new URLSearchParams(window.location.search);
const myParam = urlParams.get('myParam');

PS
Unfortunately URLSearchParams don't properly parse query strings with string keyed values.
You might want to try locutus/parse_str
console.log(new URLSearchParams('a=b&c=d').toString()); // a=b&c=d
console.log(new URLSearchParams('a=b&c=d').get('a')); // b
console.log(new URLSearchParams('filters[a]=b&filters[c]=d').toString()); // filters%5Ba%5D=b&filters%5Bc%5D=d
console.log(new URLSearchParams('filters[a]=b&filters[c]=d').get('filters')); // null

Original
You don't need jQuery for that purpose. You can use just some pure JavaScript:
function getParameterByName(name, url = window.location.href) {
    name = name.replace(/[\[\]]/g, '\\$&');
    var regex = new RegExp('[?&]' + name + '(=([^&#]*)|&|#|$)'),
        results = regex.exec(url);
    if (!results) return null;
    if (!results[2]) return '';
    return decodeURIComponent(results[2].replace(/\+/g, ' '));
}

Usage:
// query string: ?foo=lorem&bar=&baz
var foo = getParameterByName('foo'); // ""lorem""
var bar = getParameterByName('bar'); // """" (present with empty value)
var baz = getParameterByName('baz'); // """" (present with no value)
var qux = getParameterByName('qux'); // null (absent)


Note: If a parameter is present several times (`?foo=lorem&foo=ipsum`), you will get the first value (`lorem`). There is no standard about this and usages vary, see for example this question: [Authoritative position of duplicate HTTP GET query keys](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/1746507/authoritative-position-of-duplicate-http-get-query-keys).  
NOTE: The function is case-sensitive. If you prefer case-insensitive parameter name, [add 'i' modifier to RegExp][2]

This is an update based on the new URLSearchParams specs to achieve the same result more succinctly. See answer titled ""URLSearchParams"" below.
",8588,"
Some of the solutions posted here are inefficient. Repeating the regular expression search every time the script needs to access a parameter is completely unnecessary, one single function to split up the parameters into an associative-array style object is enough. If you're not working with the HTML 5 History API, this is only necessary once per page load.  The other suggestions here also fail to decode the URL correctly.
var urlParams;
(window.onpopstate = function () {
    var match,
        pl     = /\+/g,  // Regex for replacing addition symbol with a space
        search = /([^&=]+)=?([^&]*)/g,
        decode = function (s) { return decodeURIComponent(s.replace(pl, "" "")); },
        query  = window.location.search.substring(1);

    urlParams = {};
    while (match = search.exec(query))
       urlParams[decode(match[1])] = decode(match[2]);
})();
Example querystring: 

?i=main&mode=front&sid=de8d49b78a85a322c4155015fdce22c4&enc=+Hello%20&empty

Result:
 urlParams = {
    enc: "" Hello "",
    i: ""main"",
    mode: ""front"",
    sid: ""de8d49b78a85a322c4155015fdce22c4"",
    empty: """"
}

alert(urlParams[""mode""]);
// -> ""front""

alert(""empty"" in urlParams);
// -> true

This could easily be improved upon to handle array-style query strings too.  An example of this is here, but since array-style parameters aren't defined in RFC 3986 I won't pollute this answer with the source code. For those interested in a ""polluted"" version, look at campbeln's answer below.
Also, as pointed out in the comments, ; is a legal delimiter for key=value pairs.  It would require a more complicated regex to handle ; or &, which I think is unnecessary because it's rare that ; is used and I would say even more unlikely that both would be used.  If you need to support ; instead of &, just swap them in the regex.
 
If you're using a server-side preprocessing language, you might want to use its native JSON functions to do the heavy lifting for you.  For example, in PHP you can write:
<script>var urlParams = <?php echo json_encode($_GET, JSON_HEX_TAG);?>;</script>
Much simpler!
UPDATED

A new capability would be to retrieve repeated params as following myparam=1&myparam=2. There is not a specification, however, most of the current approaches follow the generation of an array.

myparam = [""1"", ""2""]

So, this is the approach to manage it:
let urlParams = {};
(window.onpopstate = function () {
    let match,
        pl = /\+/g,  // Regex for replacing addition symbol with a space
        search = /([^&=]+)=?([^&]*)/g,
        decode = function (s) {
            return decodeURIComponent(s.replace(pl, "" ""));
        },
        query = window.location.search.substring(1);

    while (match = search.exec(query)) {
        if (decode(match[1]) in urlParams) {
            if (!Array.isArray(urlParams[decode(match[1])])) {
                urlParams[decode(match[1])] = [urlParams[decode(match[1])]];
            }
            urlParams[decode(match[1])].push(decode(match[2]));
        } else {
            urlParams[decode(match[1])] = decode(match[2]);
        }
    }
})();

Using Vim I often want to replace a block of code with a block that I just yanked.
But when I delete the block of code that is to be replaced, that block itself goes into the register which erases the block I just yanked. So I've got in the habit of yanking, then inserting, then deleting what I didn't want, but with large blocks of code this gets messy trying to keep the inserted block and the block to delete separate.
So what is the slickest and quickest way to replace text in Vim?

is there a way to delete text without putting it into the register?
is there a way to say e.g. ""replace next word"" or ""replace up to next paragraph""
or is the best way to somehow use the multi-register feature?

Yep. It's slightly more convoluted than deleting the ""old"" text first, but:
I start off with..

I shift+v select the line1, line 2, 3 and 4, and delete them with the d command
Then I delete the old 1-4 lines the same way.
Then, do
""2p

That'll paste the second-last yanked lines (line 1-4). ""3p will do the third-from-last, and so on..
So I end up with
line1

I want to create an empty list (or whatever is the best way) that can hold 10 elements.
After that I want to assign values in that list, for example this is supposed to display 0 to 9:
s1 = list();
for i in range(0,9):
   s1[i] = i

print  s1

But when I run this code, it generates an error or in another case it just displays [] (empty). 
Can someone explain why?
","1,460,680",601,135,python list ,https://stackoverflow.com/questions/10712002/create-an-empty-list-in-python-with-certain-size,15,"
You cannot assign to a list like lst[i] = something, unless the list already is initialized with at least i+1 elements. You need to use append to add elements to the end of the list. lst.append(something).
(You could use the assignment notation if you were using a dictionary).
Creating an empty list:
>>> l = [None] * 10
>>> l
[None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None]

Assigning a value to an existing element of the above list:
>>> l[1] = 5
>>> l
[None, 5, None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None]

Keep in mind that something like l[15] = 5 would still fail, as our list has only 10 elements.
range(x) creates a list from [0, 1, 2, ... x-1]
# 2.X only. Use list(range(10)) in 3.X.
>>> l = range(10)
>>> l
[0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]

Using a function to create a list:
>>> def display():
...     s1 = []
...     for i in range(9): # This is just to tell you how to create a list.
...         s1.append(i)
...     return s1
... 
>>> print display()
[0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8]

List comprehension (Using the squares because for range you don't need to do all this, you can just return range(0,9) ):
>>> def display():
...     return [x**2 for x in range(9)]
... 
>>> print display()
[0, 1, 4, 9, 16, 25, 36, 49, 64]

",917,"
Try this instead:
lst = [None] * 10

The above will create a list of size 10, where each position is initialized to None. After that, you can add elements to it:
lst = [None] * 10
for i in range(10):
    lst[i] = i

Admittedly, that's not the Pythonic way to do things. Better do this:
lst = []
for i in range(10):
    lst.append(i)

Or even simpler, in Python 2.x you can do this to initialize a list with values from 0 to 9:
lst = range(10)

And in Python 3.x:
lst = list(range(10))

User kokos answered the wonderful Hidden Features of C# question by mentioning the using keyword. Can you elaborate on that? What are the uses of using?
","286,769",326,109,c# using using-statement ,https://stackoverflow.com/questions/75401/what-are-the-uses-of-using-in-c,29,"
The reason for the using statement is to ensure that the object is disposed as soon as it goes out of scope, and it doesn't require explicit code to ensure that this happens.
As in Understanding the 'using' statement in C# (codeproject) and Using objects that implement IDisposable (microsoft), the C# compiler converts
using (MyResource myRes = new MyResource())
{
    myRes.DoSomething();
}

to
{ // Limits scope of myRes
    MyResource myRes= new MyResource();
    try
    {
        myRes.DoSomething();
    }
    finally
    {
        // Check for a null resource.
        if (myRes != null)
            // Call the object's Dispose method.
            ((IDisposable)myRes).Dispose();
    }
}

C# 8 introduces a new syntax, named ""using declarations"":

A using declaration is a variable declaration preceded by the using keyword. It tells the compiler that the variable being declared should be disposed at the end of the enclosing scope.

So the equivalent code of above would be:
using var myRes = new MyResource();
myRes.DoSomething();

And when control leaves the containing scope (usually a method, but it can also be a code block), myRes will be disposed.

But it shows a different color rather than red. What kind of parameter can we pass in setTextColor()? In documentation, it says int, but is it a resource reference value or anything else?
","1,040,757",559,145,android colors textview ,https://stackoverflow.com/questions/4602902/how-to-set-the-text-color-of-textview-in-code,35,"
You should use:
holder.text.setTextColor(Color.RED);


You can use various functions from the Color class to get the same effect of course. 

Color.parseColor (Manual) (like LEX uses)
text.setTextColor(Color.parseColor(""#FFFFFF""));

Color.rgb and Color.argb (Manual rgb) (Manual argb) (like Ganapathy uses)
holder.text.setTextColor(Color.rgb(200,0,0));
holder.text.setTextColor(Color.argb(0,200,0,0));

And of course, if you want to define your color in an XML file, you can do this:
<color name=""errorColor"">#f00</color>

because the getColor() function is deprecated1, you need to use it like so:
ContextCompat.getColor(context, R.color.your_color);

You can also insert plain HEX, like so:
myTextView.setTextColor(0xAARRGGBB);

Where you have an alpha-channel first, then the color value.

Check out the complete manual of course, public class Color extends Object.

1This code used to be in here as well:
textView.setTextColor(getResources().getColor(R.color.errorColor));

This method is now deprecated in Android M. You can however use it from the contextCompat in the support library, as the example now shows.
",1275,"
If you still want to specify your colors in your XML file:
<color name=""errorColor"">#f00</color>

Then reference it in your code with one of these two methods:
textView.setTextColor(getResources().getColor(R.color.errorColor, getResources().newTheme()));    

or
textView.setTextColor(getResources().getColor(R.color.errorColor, null));

The first is probably preferable if you're compiling against Android M, however the theme you pass in can be null, so maybe that's easier for you?
And if you're using the Compat library you can do something like this
textView.setTextColor(ContextCompat.getColor(context, R.color.errorColor));

Use the communicate method.

out, err = p.communicate()

out is what you want.

Note how I passed in the command. The ""ntpq -p"" example brings up another matter. Since Popen does not invoke the shell, you would use a list of the command and options—[""ntpq"", ""-p""].

  // as event listeners
  buttons[i].addEventListener(""click"", function() {

}

for(var v of arr){
  fns.push(() => console.log(`value: ${v}`));
}

for(var f of fns){
  f();

What’s the solution to this basic problem?
","392,501",2899,1020,javascript loops closures ,https://stackoverflow.com/questions/750486/javascript-closure-inside-loops-simple-practical-example,44,"
Well, the problem is that the variable i, within each of your anonymous functions, is bound to the same variable outside of the function.
ES6 solution: let
ECMAScript 6 (ES6) introduces new let and const keywords that are scoped differently than var-based variables. For example, in a loop with a let-based index, each iteration through the loop will have a new variable i with loop scope, so your code would work as you expect. There are many resources, but I'd recommend 2ality's block-scoping post as a great source of information.
for (let i = 0; i < 3; i++) {
  funcs[i] = function() {
    console.log(""My value: "" + i);
  };
}

Beware, though, that IE9-IE11 and Edge prior to Edge 14 support let but get the above wrong (they don't create a new i each time, so all the functions above would log 3 like they would if we used var). Edge 14 finally gets it right.

ES5.1 solution: forEach
With the relatively widespread availability of the Array.prototype.forEach function (in 2015), it's worth noting that in those situations involving iteration primarily over an array of values, .forEach() provides a clean, natural way to get a distinct closure for every iteration. That is, assuming you've got some sort of array containing values (DOM references, objects, whatever), and the problem arises of setting up callbacks specific to each element, you can do this:
var someArray = [ /* whatever */ ];
// ...
someArray.forEach(function(arrayElement) {
  // ... code code code for this one element
  someAsynchronousFunction(arrayElement, function() {
    arrayElement.doSomething();
  });
});

The idea is that each invocation of the callback function used with the .forEach loop will be its own closure. The parameter passed in to that handler is the array element specific to that particular step of the iteration. If it's used in an asynchronous callback, it won't collide with any of the other callbacks established at other steps of the iteration.
If you happen to be working in jQuery, the $.each() function gives you a similar capability.

Classic solution: Closures
What you want to do is bind the variable within each function to a separate, unchanging value outside of the function:


var funcs = [];

function createfunc(i) {
  return function() {
    console.log(""My value: "" + i);
  };
}

for (var i = 0; i < 3; i++) {
  funcs[i] = createfunc(i);
}

for (var j = 0; j < 3; j++) {
  // and now let's run each one to see
  funcs[j]();
}



Since there is no block scope in JavaScript - only function scope - by wrapping the function creation in a new function, you ensure that the value of ""i"" remains as you intended.
",2206,"
Try:


var funcs = [];
    
for (var i = 0; i < 3; i++) {
    funcs[i] = (function(index) {
        return function() {
            console.log(""My value: "" + index);
        };
    }(i));
}

for (var j = 0; j < 3; j++) {
    funcs[j]();
}



Edit (2014):
Personally I think @Aust's more recent answer about using .bind is the best way to do this kind of thing now. There's also lo-dash/underscore's _.partial when you don't need or want to mess with bind's thisArg.

","1,169,527",4461,1230,http url uri urn rfc3986 ,https://stackoverflow.com/questions/176264/what-is-the-difference-between-a-uri-a-url-and-a-urn,31,"
From RFC 3986:

A URI can be further classified as a locator, a name, or both.  The
     term ""Uniform Resource Locator"" (URL) refers to the subset of URIs
     that, in addition to identifying a resource, provide a means of
     locating the resource by describing its primary access mechanism
     (e.g., its network ""location"").  The term ""Uniform Resource Name""
     (URN) has been used historically to refer to both URIs under the
     ""urn"" scheme [RFC2141], which are required to remain globally unique
     and persistent even when the resource ceases to exist or becomes
     unavailable, and to any other URI with the properties of a name.

So all URLs are URIs (actually not quite - see below), and all URNs are URIs - but URNs and URLs are different, so you can't say that all URIs are URLs.
EDIT: I had previously thought that all URLs are valid URIs, but as per comments:

Not ""all URLs are URIs"". It depends on the interpretation of the RFC. For example in Java the URI parser does not like [ or ] and that's because the spec says ""should not"" and not ""shall not"".

So that muddies the waters further, unfortunately.
If you haven't already read Roger Pate's answer, I'd advise doing so as well.
",1796,"
URIs identify and URLs locate; however, locators are also identifiers, so every URL is also a URI, but there are URIs which are not URLs.
Examples

Roger Pate

This is my name, which is an identifier.
It is like a URI, but cannot be a URL, as it tells you nothing about my location or how to contact me.
In this case it also happens to identify at least 5 other people in the USA alone.

4914 West Bay Street, Nassau, Bahamas

This is a locator, which is an identifier for that physical location.
It is like both a URL and URI (since all URLs are URIs), and also identifies me indirectly as ""resident of.."".
In this case it uniquely identifies me, but that would change if I get a roommate.
I say ""like"" because these examples do not follow the required syntax.
Popular confusion
From Wikipedia:

In computing, a Uniform Resource Locator (URL) is a subset of the Uniform Resource Identifier (URI) that specifies where an identified resource is available and the mechanism for retrieving it. In popular usage and in many technical documents and verbal discussions it is often incorrectly used as a synonym for URI, ... [emphasis mine]

Because of this common confusion, many products and documentation incorrectly use one term instead of the other, assign their own distinction, or use them synonymously.
URNs
My name, Roger Pate, could be like a URN (Uniform Resource Name), except those are much more regulated and intended to be unique across both space and time.
Because I currently share this name with other people, it's not globally unique and would not be appropriate as a URN.  However, even if no other family used this name, I'm named after my paternal grandfather, so it still wouldn't be unique across time.  And even if that wasn't the case, the possibility of naming my descendants after me make this unsuitable as a URN.
URNs are different from URLs in this rigid uniqueness constraint, even though they both share the syntax of URIs.

258,18889028,17822131,Resolving ambiguous overload on function pointer and std::function for a lambda using +,"
In the following code, the first call to foo is ambiguous, and therefore fails to compile.
The second, with the added + before the lambda, resolves to the function pointer overload.
#include <functional>

void foo(std::function<void()> f) { f(); }
void foo(void (*f)()) { f(); }

int main ()
{
    foo(  [](){} ); // ambiguous
    foo( +[](){} ); // not ambiguous (calls the function pointer overload)
}

What is the + notation doing here?
","7,610",93,31,c++11 lambda overloading ,https://stackoverflow.com/questions/17822131/resolving-ambiguous-overload-on-function-pointer-and-stdfunction-for-a-lambda,1,"
The + in the expression +[](){} is the unary + operator. It is defined as follows in 
[expr.unary.op]/7:

The operand of the unary + operator shall have arithmetic, unscoped enumeration, or pointer type and the result is the value of the argument.

The lambda is not of arithmetic type etc., but it can be converted:
[expr.prim.lambda]/3

The type of the lambda-expression [...] is a unique, unnamed non-union class type — called the closure type — whose properties are described below.

[expr.prim.lambda]/6

The closure type for a lambda-expression with no lambda-capture has a public non-virtual non-explicit const conversion function to pointer to function having the same parameter and return types as the closure type's function call operator. The value returned by this conversion function shall be the address of a function that, when invoked, has the same effect as invoking the closure type’s function call operator.

Therefore, the unary + forces the conversion to the function pointer type, which is for this lambda void (*)(). Therefore, the type of the expression +[](){} is this function pointer type void (*)().
The second overload void foo(void (*f)()) becomes an Exact Match in the ranking for overload resolution and is therefore chosen unambiguously (as the first overload is NOT an Exact Match).

The lambda [](){} can be converted to std::function<void()> via the non-explicit template ctor of std::function, which takes any type that fulfils the Callable and CopyConstructible requirements.
The lambda can also be converted to void (*)() via the conversion function of the closure type (see above).
Both are user-defined conversion sequences, and of the same rank. That's why overload resolution fails in the first example due to ambiguity.

According to Cassio Neri, backed up by an argument by Daniel Krügler, this unary + trick should be specified behaviour, i.e. you can rely on it (see discussion in the comments).
Still, I'd recommend using an explicit cast to the function pointer type if you want to avoid the ambiguity: you don't need to ask on SO what is does and why it works ;)

The simplest answer is to do:
List<Element> list = Arrays.asList(array);

This will work fine.  But some caveats:

The list returned from asList has fixed size.  So, if you want to be able to add or remove elements from the returned list in your code, you'll need to wrap it in a new ArrayList.  Otherwise you'll get an UnsupportedOperationException.
The list returned from asList() is backed by the original array.  If you modify the original array, the list will be modified as well.  This may be surprising.

I go with the simple answer. Works for me.
long startTime = System.currentTimeMillis();

doReallyLongThing();

long endTime = System.currentTimeMillis();

System.out.println(""That took "" + (endTime - startTime) + "" milliseconds"");

It works quite well. The resolution is obviously only to the millisecond, you can do better with System.nanoTime(). There are some limitations to both (operating system schedule slices, etc.) but this works pretty well.

These work as advertised:
grep -ir 'hello world' .
grep -ir hello\ world .

These don't:
argumentString1=""-ir 'hello world'""
argumentString2=""-ir hello\\ world""
grep $argumentString1 .
grep $argumentString2 .

Despite 'hello world' being enclosed by quotes in the second example, grep interprets 'hello (and hello\) as one argument and world' (and world) as another, which means that, in this case, 'hello will be the search pattern and world' will be the search path.
Again, this only happens when the arguments are expanded from the argumentString variables. grep properly interprets 'hello world' (and hello\ world) as a single argument in the first example.
Can anyone explain why this is? Is there a proper way to expand a string variable that will preserve the syntax of each character such that it is correctly interpreted by shell commands?

Why
When the string is expanded, it is split into words, but it is not re-evaluated to find special characters such as quotes or dollar signs or ...  This is the way the shell has 'always' behaved, since the Bourne shell back in 1978 or thereabouts.
Fix
In bash, use an array to hold the arguments:
argumentArray=(-ir 'hello world')
grep ""${argumentArray[@]}"" .

Or, if brave/foolhardy, use eval:
argumentString=""-ir 'hello world'""
eval ""grep $argumentString .""

On the other hand, discretion is often the better part of valour, and working with eval is a place where discretion is better than bravery.  If you are not completely in control of the string that is eval'd (if there's any user input in the command string that has not been rigorously validated), then you are opening yourself to potentially serious problems.
Note that the sequence of expansions for Bash is described in Shell Expansions in the GNU Bash manual.  Note in particular sections 3.5.3 Shell Parameter Expansion, 3.5.7 Word Splitting, and 3.5.9 Quote Removal.

When you put quote characters into variables, they just become plain literals (see http://mywiki.wooledge.org/BashFAQ/050; thanks @tripleee for pointing out this link)

As it has been mentioned before, you do not want to check whether the device is a tablet or a phone but you want to know about the features of the device,
Most of the time, the difference between a tablet and a phone is the screen size which is why you want to use different layout files. These files are stored in the res/layout-<qualifiers> directories. You can create an XML file in the directoy res/values-<same qualifiers> for each of your layouts and put an int/bool/string resource into it to distinguish between the layouts you use.
Example:
File res/values/screen.xml (assuming res/layout/ contains your layout files for handsets)
<?xml version=""1.0"" encoding=""utf-8""?>
<resources>
  <string name=""screen_type"">phone</string>
</resources>


File res/values-sw600dp/screen.xml (assuming res/layout-sw600dp/ contains your layout files for small tablets like the Nexus 7) 
<?xml version=""1.0"" encoding=""utf-8""?>
<resources>
  <string name=""screen_type"">7-inch-tablet</string>
</resources>


File res/values-sw720dp/screen.xml (assuming res/layout-sw720dp/ contains your layout files for large tablets like the Nexus 10): 
<?xml version=""1.0"" encoding=""utf-8""?>
<resources>
  <string name=""screen_type"">10-inch-tablet</string>
</resources>


Now the screen type is accessible via the R.string.screen_type constant.

Integer.toString calls the static method in the class Integer. It does not need an instance of Integer.
If you call new Integer(i) you create an instance of type Integer, which is a full Java object encapsulating the value of your int. Then you call the toString method on it to ask it to return a string representation of itself.
If all you want is to print an int, you'd use the first one because it's lighter, faster and doesn't use extra memory (aside from the returned string).  
If you want an object representing an integer value—to put it inside a collection for example—you'd use the second one, since it gives you a full-fledged object to do all sort of things that you cannot do with a bare int.

How it works:

When you have two inline-block elements near each other, you can align each to other's side, so with vertical-align: middle you'll get something like this:

When you have a block with fixed height (in px, em or another absolute unit), you can set the height of inner blocks in %.
So, adding one inline-block with height: 100% in a block with fixed height would align another inline-block element in it (<img/> in your case) vertically near it.

267,3839966,2067472,"What is JSONP, and why was it created?","
I understand JSON, but not JSONP. Wikipedia's document on JSON is (was) the top search result for JSONP. It says this:

Huh? What call? That doesn't make any sense to me. JSON is a data format. There's no call.
The 2nd search result is from some guy named Remy, who writes this about JSONP:

JSONP is script tag injection, passing the response from the server in to a user specified function.

I can sort of understand that, but it's still not making any sense.

So what is JSONP? Why was it created (what problem does it solve)? And why would I use it? 

Addendum: I've just created a new page for JSONP on Wikipedia; it now has a clear and thorough description of JSONP, based on jvenema's answer.

It's actually not too complicated...
Say you're on domain example.com, and you want to make a request to domain example.net. To do so, you need to cross domain boundaries, a no-no in most of browserland. 
The one item that bypasses this limitation is <script> tags. When you use a script tag, the domain limitation is ignored, but under normal circumstances, you can't really do anything with the results, the script just gets evaluated.
Enter JSONP. When you make your request to a server that is JSONP enabled, you pass a special parameter that tells the server a little bit about your page. That way, the server is able to nicely wrap up its response in a way that your page can handle. 
For example, say the server expects a parameter called callback to enable its JSONP capabilities. Then your request would look like:
http://www.example.net/sample.aspx?callback=mycallback

Without JSONP, this might return some basic JavaScript object, like so:
{ foo: 'bar' }

However, with JSONP, when the server receives the ""callback"" parameter, it wraps up the result a little differently, returning something like this:
mycallback({ foo: 'bar' });

As you can see, it will now invoke the method you specified. So, in your page, you define the callback function:
mycallback = function(data){
  alert(data.foo);
};

And now, when the script is loaded, it'll be evaluated, and your function will be executed. Voila, cross-domain requests!
It's also worth noting the one major issue with JSONP: you lose a lot of control of the request. For example, there is no ""nice"" way to get proper failure codes back. As a result, you end up using timers to monitor the request, etc, which is always a bit suspect. The proposition for JSONRequest is a great solution to allowing cross domain scripting, maintaining security, and allowing proper control of the request.
These days (2015), CORS is the recommended approach vs. JSONRequest. JSONP is still useful for older browser support, but given the security implications, unless you have no choice CORS is the better choice.
",2096,"
JSONP is really a simple trick to overcome the XMLHttpRequest same domain policy. (As you know one cannot send AJAX (XMLHttpRequest) request to a different domain.)
So - instead of using XMLHttpRequest we have to use script HTML tags, the ones you usually use to load js files, in order for js to get data from another domain. Sounds weird?
Thing is - turns out script tags can be used in a fashion similar to XMLHttpRequest! Check this out:
script = document.createElement('script');
script.type = 'text/javascript';
script.src = 'http://www.someWebApiServer.com/some-data';

You will end up with a script segment that looks like this after it loads the data:
<script>
{['some string 1', 'some data', 'whatever data']}
</script>

However this is a bit inconvenient, because we have to fetch this array from script tag. So JSONP creators decided that this will work better(and it is):
script = document.createElement('script');
script.type = 'text/javascript';
script.src = 'http://www.someWebApiServer.com/some-data?callback=my_callback';

Notice the my_callback function over there? So - when JSONP server receives your request and finds callback parameter - instead of returning plain js array it'll return this:
my_callback({['some string 1', 'some data', 'whatever data']});

See where the profit is: now we get automatic callback (my_callback) that'll be triggered once we get the data.
That's all there is to know about JSONP: it's a callback and script tags.
NOTE: these are simple examples of JSONP usage,  these are not production ready scripts.

        { ""id"": ""5004"", ""type"": ""Maple"" }
    ]
}

How do I decode this in PHP and access the resulting data?
","305,714",226,126,php json ,https://stackoverflow.com/questions/29308898/how-do-i-extract-data-from-json-with-php,6,"
Intro
First off you have a string. JSON is not an array, an object, or a data structure. JSON is a text-based serialization format - so a fancy string, but still just a string. Decode it in PHP by using json_decode().
 $data = json_decode($json);

Therein you might find:

scalars: strings, ints, floats, and bools
nulls (a special type of its own)
compound types: objects and arrays.

These are the things that can be encoded in JSON. Or more accurately, these are PHP's versions of the things that can be encoded in JSON.
There's nothing special about them. They are not ""JSON objects"" or ""JSON arrays."" You've decoded the JSON - you now have basic everyday PHP types.
Objects will be instances of stdClass, a built-in class which is just a generic thing that's not important here.

Accessing object properties
You access the properties of one of these objects the same way you would for the public non-static properties of any other object, e.g. $object->property.
$json = '
{
    ""type"": ""donut"",
    ""name"": ""Cake""
}';

$yummy = json_decode($json);

echo $yummy->type; //donut


Accessing array elements
You access the elements of one of these arrays the same way you would for any other array, e.g. $array[0].
$json = '
[
    ""Glazed"",
    ""Chocolate with Sprinkles"",
    ""Maple""
]';

$toppings = json_decode($json);

echo $toppings[1]; //Chocolate with Sprinkles

Iterate over it with foreach.
foreach ($toppings as $topping) {
    echo $topping, ""\n"";
}


Glazed 
  Chocolate with Sprinkles 
  Maple

Or mess about with any of the bazillion built-in array functions.

Accessing nested items
The properties of objects and the elements of arrays might be more objects and/or arrays - you can simply continue to access their properties and members as usual, e.g. $object->array[0]->etc.
$json = '
{
    ""type"": ""donut"",
    ""name"": ""Cake"",
    ""toppings"": [
        { ""id"": ""5002"", ""type"": ""Glazed"" },
        { ""id"": ""5006"", ""type"": ""Chocolate with Sprinkles"" },
        { ""id"": ""5004"", ""type"": ""Maple"" }
    ]
}';

$yummy = json_decode($json);

echo $yummy->toppings[2]->id; //5004


Passing true as the second argument to json_decode()
When you do this, instead of objects you'll get associative arrays - arrays with strings for keys. Again you access the elements thereof as usual, e.g. $array['key'].
$json = '
{
    ""type"": ""donut"",
    ""name"": ""Cake"",
    ""toppings"": [
        { ""id"": ""5002"", ""type"": ""Glazed"" },
        { ""id"": ""5006"", ""type"": ""Chocolate with Sprinkles"" },
        { ""id"": ""5004"", ""type"": ""Maple"" }
    ]
}';

$yummy = json_decode($json, true);

echo $yummy['toppings'][2]['type']; //Maple


Accessing associative array items
When decoding a JSON object to an associative PHP array, you can iterate both keys and values using the foreach (array_expression as $key => $value) syntax, eg
$json = '
{
    ""foo"": ""foo value"",
    ""bar"": ""bar value"",
    ""baz"": ""baz value""
}';

$assoc = json_decode($json, true);
foreach ($assoc as $key => $value) {
    echo ""The value of key '$key' is '$value'"", PHP_EOL;
}

Prints

The value of key 'foo' is 'foo value'
  The value of key 'bar' is 'bar value'
  The value of key 'baz' is 'baz value'


Don't know how the data is structured
Read the documentation for whatever it is you're getting the JSON from.
Look at the JSON - where you see curly brackets {} expect an object, where you see square brackets [] expect an array.
Hit the decoded data with a print_r():
$json = '
{
    ""type"": ""donut"",
    ""name"": ""Cake"",
    ""toppings"": [
        { ""id"": ""5002"", ""type"": ""Glazed"" },
        { ""id"": ""5006"", ""type"": ""Chocolate with Sprinkles"" },
        { ""id"": ""5004"", ""type"": ""Maple"" }
    ]
}';

$yummy = json_decode($json);

print_r($yummy);

and check the output:
stdClass Object
(
    [type] => donut
    [name] => Cake
    [toppings] => Array
        (
            [0] => stdClass Object
                (
                    [id] => 5002
                    [type] => Glazed
                )

            [1] => stdClass Object
                (
                    [id] => 5006
                    [type] => Chocolate with Sprinkles
                )

            [2] => stdClass Object
                (
                    [id] => 5004
                    [type] => Maple
                )

        )

)

It'll tell you where you have objects, where you have arrays, along with the names and values of their members.
If you can only get so far into it before you get lost - go that far and hit that with print_r():
print_r($yummy->toppings[0]);

stdClass Object
(
    [id] => 5002
    [type] => Glazed
)

Take a look at it in this handy interactive JSON explorer.
Break the problem down into pieces that are easier to wrap your head around.

json_decode() returns null
This happens because either:

The JSON consists entirely of just that, null.
The JSON is invalid - check the result of json_last_error_msg or put it through something like JSONLint.
It contains elements nested more than 512 levels deep. This default max depth can be overridden by passing an integer as the third argument to json_decode().

If you need to change the max depth you're probably solving the wrong problem. Find out why you're getting such deeply nested data (e.g. the service you're querying that's generating the JSON has a bug) and get that to not happen.

Object property name contains a special character
Sometimes you'll have an object property name that contains something like a hyphen - or at sign @ which can't be used in a literal identifier. Instead you can use a string literal within curly braces to address it.
$json = '{""@attributes"":{""answer"":42}}';
$thing = json_decode($json);

echo $thing->{'@attributes'}->answer; //42

If you have an integer as property see: How to access object properties with names like integers? as reference.

Someone put JSON in your JSON
It's ridiculous but it happens - there's JSON encoded as a string within your JSON. Decode, access the string as usual, decode that, and eventually get to what you need.
$json = '
{
    ""type"": ""donut"",
    ""name"": ""Cake"",
    ""toppings"": ""[{ \""type\"": \""Glazed\"" }, { \""type\"": \""Maple\"" }]""
}';

$yummy = json_decode($json);
$toppings = json_decode($yummy->toppings);

echo $toppings[0]->type; //Glazed


Data doesn't fit in memory
If your JSON is too large for json_decode() to handle at once things start to get tricky. See:

Processing large JSON files in PHP
How to properly iterate through a big json file


How to sort it
See: Reference: all basic ways to sort arrays and data in PHP.
",453,"
You can use json_decode() to convert a json string to a PHP object/array.
Eg.
Input:
$json = '{""a"":1,""b"":2,""c"":3,""d"":4,""e"":5}';

var_dump(json_decode($json));
var_dump(json_decode($json, true));

Output:
object(stdClass)#1 (5) {
    [""a""] => int(1)
    [""b""] => int(2)
    [""c""] => int(3)
    [""d""] => int(4)
    [""e""] => int(5)
}

array(5) {
    [""a""] => int(1)
    [""b""] => int(2)
    [""c""] => int(3)
    [""d""] => int(4)
    [""e""] => int(5)
}

Few Points to remember:

json_decode requires the string to be a valid json else it will return NULL.
In the event of a failure to decode, json_last_error() can be used to determine the exact nature of the error.
Make sure you pass in utf8 content, or json_decode may error out and just return a NULL value.

array_key_exists() purely checks if the key exists, even if the value is NULL.

Its description from the official JavaDoc:

tl;dr:
ContextCompat.getColor(context, R.color.my_color)

Explanation:
You will need to use ContextCompat.getColor(), which is part of the Support V4 Library (it will work for all the previous APIs).
ContextCompat.getColor(context, R.color.my_color)

If you don't already use the Support Library, you will need to add the following line to the dependencies array inside your app build.gradle (note: it's optional if you already use the appcompat (V7) library):
compile 'com.android.support:support-v4:23.0.0' # or any version above

For the complete list of attributes, the short answer is: no. The problem is that the attributes are actually defined as the arguments accepted by the getattr built-in function. As the user can reimplement __getattr__, suddenly allowing any kind of attribute, there is no possible generic way to generate that list. The dir function returns the keys in the __dict__ attribute, i.e. all the attributes accessible if the __getattr__ method is not reimplemented.
For the second question, it does not really make sense. Actually, methods are callable attributes, nothing more. You could though filter callable attributes, and, using the inspect module determine the class methods, methods or functions.

UPDATE 4
Same like update 3 but with modern css (=less rules) so that no special positioning on the pseudo element is required.


#box {
    background-color: #3D6AA2;
    width: 160px;
    height: 90px;
    position: absolute;
    top: calc(10% - 10px);
    left: calc(50% - 80px);
}

.box-shadow:after {
    content:"""";
    position:absolute;
    width:100%;
    bottom:1px;
    z-index:-1;
    transform:scale(.9);
    box-shadow: 0px 0px 8px 2px #000000;
}
<div id=""box"" class=""box-shadow""></div>



UPDATE 3
All my previous answers have been using extra markup to get create this effect, which is not necessarily needed. I think this a much cleaner solution... the only trick is playing around with the values to get the right positioning of the shadow as well as the right strength/opacity of the shadow. Here's a new fiddle, using pseudo-elements:
http://jsfiddle.net/UnsungHero97/ARRRZ/2/
HTML
<div id=""box"" class=""box-shadow""></div>

CSS
#box {
    background-color: #3D6AA2;
    width: 160px;
    height: 90px;
    margin-top: -45px;
    margin-left: -80px;
    position: absolute;
    top: 50%;
    left: 50%;
}

.box-shadow:after {
    content: """";
    width: 150px;
    height: 1px;
    margin-top: 88px;
    margin-left: -75px;
    display: block;
    position: absolute;
    left: 50%;
    z-index: -1;
    -webkit-box-shadow: 0px 0px 8px 2px #000000;
       -moz-box-shadow: 0px 0px 8px 2px #000000;
            box-shadow: 0px 0px 8px 2px #000000;
}

UPDATE 2
Apparently, you can do this with just an extra parameter to the box-shadow CSS as everyone else just pointed out. Here's the demo:
http://jsfiddle.net/K88H9/821/
CSS
-webkit-box-shadow: 0 4px 4px -2px #000000;
   -moz-box-shadow: 0 4px 4px -2px #000000;
        box-shadow: 0 4px 4px -2px #000000;

This would be a better solution. The extra parameter that is added is described as:

The fourth length is a spread
  distance. Positive values cause the
  shadow shape to expand in all
  directions by the specified radius.
  Negative values cause the shadow shape
  to contract.

UPDATE
Check out the demo at jsFiddle: http://jsfiddle.net/K88H9/4/
What I did was create a ""shadow element"" that would hide behind the actual element that you would want to have a shadow. I made the width of the ""shadow element"" to be exactly less wide than the actual element by 2 times the shadow you specify; then I aligned it properly.
HTML
<div id=""wrapper"">
    <div id=""element""></div>
    <div id=""shadow""></div>

       -moz-box-shadow: 0px 2px 4px #000000;
            box-shadow: 0px 2px 4px #000000;
}

Original Answer
Yes, you can do this with the same syntax you have provided. The first value controls the horizontal positioning and the second value controls the vertical positioning. So just set the first value to 0px and the second to whatever offset you'd like as follows:
-webkit-box-shadow: 0px 5px #000000;
   -moz-box-shadow: 0px 5px #000000;
        box-shadow: 0px 5px #000000;

Just use the spread parameter to make the shadow smaller:


.shadow {
  -webkit-box-shadow: 0 6px 4px -4px black;
  -moz-box-shadow: 0 6px 4px -4px black;
  box-shadow: 0 6px 4px -4px black;
}
<div class=""shadow"">Some content</div>



Live demo: http://dabblet.com/gist/a8f8ba527f5cff607327
To not see any shadow on the sides, the (absolute value of the) spread radius (4th parameter) needs to be the same as the blur radius (3rd parameter).

Those are conflict markers. You're still in the process of merging, but there were some parts that Git couldn't merge automatically. You'll need to hand-edit those parts to what you want them to be and then commit the results.

For instance, in your particular case, you'd probably want to resolve it like this (note - the arrows/text on the right are just my notes, not something you'd type into the file):
integer = 
<<<<<<< HEAD                                  <-+ remove the bits here
    digits:[0-9]+                               |
        { return digits.join(""""); }             |
=======                                       <-+

        { return sign + digits.join(""""); }
>>>>>>> gh-pages                              <-- and this

and thus you'd save the file as...
integer = 
    sign:""-""* digits:[0-9]+
        { return sign + digits.join(""""); }

",97,"
Absolutely start with 'git status' to see what you've got.  If you aborted a merge (or had a merge aborted) and you've got conflicted files in the working directory then something went wrong.  The Git status will tell you where you are.  After that, you have a number of options.  You should resolve the merge commit either by-hand, which can be challenging, or using a tool as:
git mergetool

The merge tool will work if your files are listed as needing a merge.  
You can also perform one of:
git checkout --ours -- /path/to/conflicted-file       # this is probably the one you want
git checkout --theirs -- /path/to/conflicted-file

You can see the different versions using the :1:filename syntax.  See here for an explanation.  But all of the above assumes that 'git status' shows the files as needing a merge.
Finally, you always have the option of:
git reset --hard   # sounds like --hard is what you need but check other options

Use of java.net.URLConnection is asked about pretty often here, and the Oracle tutorial is too concise about it. 
That tutorial basically only shows how to fire a GET request and read the response. It doesn't explain anywhere how to use it to among others perform a POST request, set request headers, read response headers, deal with cookies, submit a HTML form, upload a file, etc. 
So, how can I use java.net.URLConnection to fire and handle ""advanced"" HTTP requests?
","1,047,790",1973,1342,java http httprequest httpurlconnection urlconnection ,https://stackoverflow.com/questions/2793150/how-to-use-java-net-urlconnection-to-fire-and-handle-http-requests,11,"
First a disclaimer beforehand: the posted code snippets are all basic examples. You'll need to handle trivial IOExceptions and RuntimeExceptions like NullPointerException, ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException and consorts yourself.

Preparing
We first need to know at least the URL and the charset. The parameters are optional and depend on the functional requirements.
String url = ""http://example.com"";
String charset = ""UTF-8"";  // Or in Java 7 and later, use the constant: java.nio.charset.StandardCharsets.UTF_8.name()
String param1 = ""value1"";
String param2 = ""value2"";
// ...

String query = String.format(""param1=%s&param2=%s"", 
     URLEncoder.encode(param1, charset), 
     URLEncoder.encode(param2, charset));

The query parameters must be in name=value format and be concatenated by &. You would normally also URL-encode the query parameters with the specified charset using URLEncoder#encode().
The String#format() is just for convenience. I prefer it when I would need the String concatenation operator + more than twice.

Firing an HTTP GET request with (optionally) query parameters
It's a trivial task. It's the default request method.
URLConnection connection = new URL(url + ""?"" + query).openConnection();
connection.setRequestProperty(""Accept-Charset"", charset);
InputStream response = connection.getInputStream();
// ...

Any query string should be concatenated to the URL using ?. The Accept-Charset header may hint the server what encoding the parameters are in. If you don't send any query string, then you can leave the Accept-Charset header away. If you don't need to set any headers, then you can even use the URL#openStream() shortcut method.
InputStream response = new URL(url).openStream();
// ...

Either way, if the other side is an HttpServlet, then its doGet() method will be called and the parameters will be available by HttpServletRequest#getParameter().
For testing purposes, you can print the response body to stdout as below:
try (Scanner scanner = new Scanner(response)) {
    String responseBody = scanner.useDelimiter(""\\A"").next();
    System.out.println(responseBody);
}


Firing an HTTP POST request with query parameters
Setting the URLConnection#setDoOutput() to true implicitly sets the request method to POST. The standard HTTP POST as web forms do is of type application/x-www-form-urlencoded wherein the query string is written to the request body.
URLConnection connection = new URL(url).openConnection();
connection.setDoOutput(true); // Triggers POST.
connection.setRequestProperty(""Accept-Charset"", charset);
connection.setRequestProperty(""Content-Type"", ""application/x-www-form-urlencoded;charset="" + charset);

try (OutputStream output = connection.getOutputStream()) {
    output.write(query.getBytes(charset));
}

InputStream response = connection.getInputStream();
// ...

Note: whenever you'd like to submit a HTML form programmatically, don't forget to take the name=value pairs of any <input type=""hidden""> elements into the query string and of course also the name=value pair of the <input type=""submit""> element which you'd like to ""press"" programmatically (because that's usually been used in the server side to distinguish if a button was pressed and if so, which one).
You can also cast the obtained URLConnection to HttpURLConnection and use its HttpURLConnection#setRequestMethod() instead. But if you're trying to use the connection for output you still need to set URLConnection#setDoOutput() to true.
HttpURLConnection httpConnection = (HttpURLConnection) new URL(url).openConnection();
httpConnection.setRequestMethod(""POST"");
// ...

Either way, if the other side is an HttpServlet, then its doPost() method will be called and the parameters will be available by HttpServletRequest#getParameter().

Actually firing the HTTP request
You can fire the HTTP request explicitly with URLConnection#connect(), but the request will automatically be fired on demand when you want to get any information about the HTTP response, such as the response body using URLConnection#getInputStream() and so on. The above examples does exactly that, so the connect() call is in fact superfluous.

Gathering HTTP response information

HTTP response status:

You need an HttpURLConnection here. Cast it first if necessary.
    int status = httpConnection.getResponseCode();


HTTP response headers:
 for (Entry<String, List<String>> header : connection.getHeaderFields().entrySet()) {
     System.out.println(header.getKey() + ""="" + header.getValue());
 }


HTTP response encoding:


When the Content-Type contains a charset parameter, then the response body is likely text based and we'd like to process the response body with the server-side specified character encoding then.
    String contentType = connection.getHeaderField(""Content-Type"");
    String charset = null;

    for (String param : contentType.replace("" "", """").split("";"")) {
        if (param.startsWith(""charset="")) {
            charset = param.split(""="", 2)[1];
            break;
        }
    }

    if (charset != null) {
        try (BufferedReader reader = new BufferedReader(new InputStreamReader(response, charset))) {
            for (String line; (line = reader.readLine()) != null;) {
                // ... System.out.println(line) ?
            }
        }
    } else {
        // It's likely binary content, use InputStream/OutputStream.
    }


Maintaining the session
The server side session is usually backed by a cookie. Some web forms require that you're logged in and/or are tracked by a session. You can use the CookieHandler API to maintain cookies. You need to prepare a CookieManager with a CookiePolicy of ACCEPT_ALL before sending all HTTP requests.
// First set the default cookie manager.
CookieHandler.setDefault(new CookieManager(null, CookiePolicy.ACCEPT_ALL));

// All the following subsequent URLConnections will use the same cookie manager.
URLConnection connection = new URL(url).openConnection();
// ...

connection = new URL(url).openConnection();
// ...

connection = new URL(url).openConnection();
// ...

Note that this is known to not always work properly in all circumstances. If it fails for you, then best is to manually gather and set the cookie headers. You basically need to grab all Set-Cookie headers from the response of the login or the first GET request and then pass this through the subsequent requests.
// Gather all cookies on the first request.
URLConnection connection = new URL(url).openConnection();
List<String> cookies = connection.getHeaderFields().get(""Set-Cookie"");
// ...

// Then use the same cookies on all subsequent requests.
connection = new URL(url).openConnection();
for (String cookie : cookies) {
    connection.addRequestProperty(""Cookie"", cookie.split("";"", 2)[0]);
}
// ...

The split("";"", 2)[0] is there to get rid of cookie attributes which are irrelevant for the server side like expires, path, etc. Alternatively, you could also use cookie.substring(0, cookie.indexOf(';')) instead of split().

Streaming mode
The HttpURLConnection will by default buffer the entire request body before actually sending it, regardless of whether you've set a fixed content length yourself using connection.setRequestProperty(""Content-Length"", contentLength);. This may cause OutOfMemoryExceptions whenever you concurrently send large POST requests (e.g. uploading files). To avoid this, you would like to set the HttpURLConnection#setFixedLengthStreamingMode().
httpConnection.setFixedLengthStreamingMode(contentLength);

But if the content length is really not known beforehand, then you can make use of chunked streaming mode by setting the HttpURLConnection#setChunkedStreamingMode() accordingly. This will set the HTTP Transfer-Encoding header to chunked which will force the request body being sent in chunks. The below example will send the body in chunks of 1KB.
httpConnection.setChunkedStreamingMode(1024);


User-Agent
It can happen that a request returns an unexpected response, while it works fine with a real web browser. The server side is probably blocking requests based on the User-Agent request header. The URLConnection will by default set it to Java/1.6.0_19 where the last part is obviously the JRE version. You can override this as follows:
connection.setRequestProperty(""User-Agent"", ""Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/41.0.2228.0 Safari/537.36""); // Do as if you're using Chrome 41 on Windows 7.

Use the User-Agent string from a recent browser.

Error handling
If the HTTP response code is 4nn (Client Error) or 5nn (Server Error), then you may want to read the HttpURLConnection#getErrorStream() to see if the server has sent any useful error information.
InputStream error = ((HttpURLConnection) connection).getErrorStream();

If the HTTP response code is -1, then something went wrong with connection and response handling. The HttpURLConnection implementation is in older JREs somewhat buggy with keeping connections alive. You may want to turn it off by setting the http.keepAlive system property to false. You can do this programmatically in the beginning of your application by:
System.setProperty(""http.keepAlive"", ""false"");


Uploading files
You'd normally use multipart/form-data encoding for mixed POST content (binary and character data). The encoding is in more detail described in RFC2388.
String param = ""value"";
File textFile = new File(""/path/to/file.txt"");
File binaryFile = new File(""/path/to/file.bin"");
String boundary = Long.toHexString(System.currentTimeMillis()); // Just generate some unique random value.
String CRLF = ""\r\n""; // Line separator required by multipart/form-data.
URLConnection connection = new URL(url).openConnection();
connection.setDoOutput(true);
connection.setRequestProperty(""Content-Type"", ""multipart/form-data; boundary="" + boundary);

try (
    OutputStream output = connection.getOutputStream();
    PrintWriter writer = new PrintWriter(new OutputStreamWriter(output, charset), true);
) {
    // Send normal param.
    writer.append(""--"" + boundary).append(CRLF);

If the other side is an HttpServlet, then its doPost() method will be called and the parts will be available by HttpServletRequest#getPart() (note, thus not getParameter() and so on!). The getPart() method is however relatively new, it's introduced in Servlet 3.0 (Glassfish 3, Tomcat 7, etc). Prior to Servlet 3.0, your best choice is using Apache Commons FileUpload to parse a multipart/form-data request. Also see this answer for examples of both the FileUpload and the Servelt 3.0 approaches.

Dealing with untrusted or misconfigured HTTPS sites
Sometimes you need to connect an HTTPS URL, perhaps because you're writing a web scraper. In that case, you may likely face a javax.net.ssl.SSLException: Not trusted server certificate on some HTTPS sites who doesn't keep their SSL certificates up to date, or a java.security.cert.CertificateException: No subject alternative DNS name matching [hostname] found or javax.net.ssl.SSLProtocolException: handshake alert: unrecognized_name on some misconfigured HTTPS sites.
The following one-time-run static initializer in your web scraper class should make HttpsURLConnection more lenient as to those HTTPS sites and thus not throw those exceptions anymore.
static {
    TrustManager[] trustAllCertificates = new TrustManager[] {
        new X509TrustManager() {
            @Override
            public X509Certificate[] getAcceptedIssuers() {
                return null; // Not relevant.
            }
            @Override
            public void checkClientTrusted(X509Certificate[] certs, String authType) {
                // Do nothing. Just allow them all.
            }
            @Override

                // Do nothing. Just allow them all.
            }
        }
    };

    HostnameVerifier trustAllHostnames = new HostnameVerifier() {

When working with HTTP it's almost always more useful to refer to HttpURLConnection rather than the base class URLConnection (since URLConnection is an abstract class when you ask for URLConnection.openConnection() on a HTTP URL that's what you'll get back anyway).
Then you can instead of relying on URLConnection#setDoOutput(true) to implicitly set the request method to POST instead do httpURLConnection.setRequestMethod(""POST"") which some might find more natural (and which also allows you to specify other request methods such as PUT, DELETE, ...).
It also provides useful HTTP constants so you can do:
int responseCode = httpURLConnection.getResponseCode();

if (responseCode == HttpURLConnection.HTTP_OK) {

What’s the difference between \n (newline) and \r (carriage return)?
In particular, are there any practical differences between \n and \r? Are there places where one should be used instead of the other?
","470,119",629,220,newline carriage-return ,https://stackoverflow.com/questions/1761051/difference-between-n-and-r,10,"
In terms of ascii code, it's 3 -- since they're 10 and 13 respectively;-).
But seriously, there are many:

in Unix and all Unix-like systems, \n is the code for end-of-line, \r means nothing special
as a consequence, in C and most languages that somehow copy it (even remotely), \n is the standard escape sequence for end of line (translated to/from OS-specific sequences as needed)
in old Mac systems (pre-OS X), \r was the code for end-of-line instead
in Windows (and many old OSs), the code for end of line is 2 characters, \r\n, in this order
as a (surprising;-) consequence (harking back to OSs much older than Windows), \r\n is the standard line-termination for text formats on the Internet
for electromechanical teletype-like ""terminals"", \r commands the carriage to go back leftwards until it hits the leftmost stop (a slow operation), \n commands the roller to roll up one line (a much faster operation) -- that's the reason you always have \r before \n, so that the roller can move while the carriage is still going leftwards!-) Wikipedia has a more detailed explanation.
for character-mode terminals (typically emulating even-older printing ones as above), in raw mode, \r and \n act similarly (except both in terms of the cursor, as there is no carriage or roller;-)

In practice, in the modern context of writing to a text file, you should always use \n (the underlying runtime will translate that if you're on a weird OS, e.g., Windows;-). The only reason to use \r is if you're writing to a character terminal (or more likely a ""console window"" emulating it) and want the next line you write to overwrite the last one you just wrote (sometimes used for goofy ""ascii animation"" effects of e.g. progress bars) -- this is getting pretty obsolete in a world of GUIs, though;-).

There are two ways to access properties of an object:

Dot notation: something.bar
Bracket notation: something['bar']

The value between the brackets can be any expression. Therefore, if the property name is stored in a variable, you have to use bracket notation:


var something = {
  bar: 'foo'
};
var foo = 'bar';

// both x = something[foo] and something[foo] = x work as expected

The new socket is an application-level concept introduced because each established connection needs a unique file descriptor (also distinct from the listening file descriptor), which maps to, but isn't the same as, a TCP session. The session itself is identified by the combination of source and destination address and port. The source (client) port is usually chosen at random, while the destination (server) port is the listen port. No additional port is allocated.
",37,"
The server use the same port to listen and accept new connection, and communicate to the remote client.
Let's me give you an example, (in linux system):
First, start a http server by python：

Second use nc command to connect to the http server, here we start two client by:

Use netstat to see the netstate of port 500:
xiongyu@ubuntu:~$ netstat -natp |grep ':500'

","668,261",835,229,python module reload python-import ,https://stackoverflow.com/questions/437589/how-do-i-unload-reload-a-python-module,20,"
You can reload a module when it has already been imported by using the reload builtin function (Python 3.4+ only):
from importlib import reload  
import foo

while True:
    # Do some things.
    if is_changed(foo):
        foo = reload(foo)

In Python 3, reload was moved to the imp module. In 3.4, imp was deprecated in favor of importlib, and reload was added to the latter. When targeting 3 or later, either reference the appropriate module when calling reload or import it.
I think that this is what you want. Web servers like Django's development server use this so that you can see the effects of your code changes without restarting the server process itself.
To quote from the docs:

Python modules’ code is recompiled and
  the module-level code reexecuted,
  defining a new set of objects which
  are bound to names in the module’s
  dictionary. The init function of
  extension modules is not called a
  second time. As with all other objects
  in Python the old objects are only
  reclaimed after their reference counts
  drop to zero. The names in the module
  namespace are updated to point to any
  new or changed objects. Other
  references to the old objects (such as
  names external to the module) are not
  rebound to refer to the new objects
  and must be updated in each namespace
  where they occur if that is desired.

As you noted in your question, you'll have to reconstruct Foo objects if the Foo class resides in the foo module.

In Python 3.0–3.3 you would use: imp.reload(module)
The BDFL has answered this question.

Just for completeness as nobody else has mentioned it.  The third parameter to an array slice is a step.  So reversing a string is as simple as:
some_string[::-1]

Or selecting alternate characters would be:
""H-e-l-l-o- -W-o-r-l-d""[::2] # outputs ""Hello World""

The ability to step forwards and backwards through the string maintains consistency with being able to array slice from the start or end.

You need to enable logging for the the following categories:

org.hibernate.SQL   - set to debug to log all SQL DML statements as they are executed
org.hibernate.type - set to trace to log all JDBC parameters

So a log4j configuration could look like:
# logs the SQL statements
log4j.logger.org.hibernate.SQL=debug 

# Logs the JDBC parameters passed to a query
log4j.logger.org.hibernate.type=trace 

The first is equivalent to hibernate.show_sql=true legacy property, the second prints the bound parameters among other things.
Another solution (non hibernate based) would be to use a JDBC proxy driver like P6Spy.

Just for convenience, here is the same configuration example for Logback (SLF4J)
<appender name=""SQLROLLINGFILE"">
 <File>/tmp/sql.log</File>
 <rollingPolicy>
  <FileNamePattern>logFile.%d{yyyy-MM-dd}.log</FileNamePattern>
 </rollingPolicy>
 <layout>
  <Pattern>%-4date | %msg %n</Pattern>
 </layout>
</appender>

<logger name=""org.hibernate.SQL"" additivity=""false"" >   
 <level value=""DEBUG"" />    
 <appender-ref ref=""SQLROLLINGFILE"" />
</logger>

<logger name=""org.hibernate.type"" additivity=""false"" >
 <level value=""TRACE"" />
 <appender-ref ref=""SQLROLLINGFILE"" />
</logger>

The output in your sql.log (example) then looks like this:

288,2920416,39527571,Are shell scripts sensitive to encoding and line endings?,"
I am making a NW.js app on Mac, and want to run the app in dev mode by double-clicking on an icon. First step, I'm trying to make my shell script work.
Using VSCode on Windows (I wanted to gain time), I have created a run-nw file at the root of my project, containing this:
#!/bin/bash

cd ""src""
npm install

cd ..
./tools/nwjs-sdk-v0.17.3-osx-x64/nwjs.app/Contents/MacOS/nwjs ""src"" &

but I get this output:
$ sh ./run-nw

: command not found  
: No such file or directory  
: command not found  
: No such file or directory  

Usage: npm <command>

where <command> is one of:  (snip commands list)

(snip npm help)

npm@3.10.3 /usr/local/lib/node_modules/npm  
: command not found  
: No such file or directory  
: command not found

I really don't understand:

it seems that it takes empty lines as commands. In my editor (VSCode) I have tried to replace \r\n with \n (in case the \r creates problems) but it changes nothing.
it seems that it doesn't find the folders (with or without the dirname instruction), or maybe it doesn't know about the cd command ?
it seems that it doesn't understand the install argument to npm
the part that really weirds me out, is that it still runs the app (if I did a npm install manually)...

Not able to make it work properly, and suspecting something weird with the file itself, I created a new one directly on the Mac, using vim this time. I entered the exact same instructions, and... now it works without any issue.
A diff on the two files reveals exactly zero difference.
What can be the difference? What can make the first script not work? How can I find out?
Update
Following the accepted answer's recommandations, after the wrong line endings came back, I checked multiple things. It turns out that since I copied my ~/.gitconfig from my Windows machine, I had autocrlf=true, so every time I modified the bash file under Windows, it re-set the line endings to \r\n.
So, in addition to running dos2unix (which you will have to install using Homebrew on mac), if you're using Git, check your config.
","23,629",49,21,bash shell sh ,https://stackoverflow.com/questions/39527571/are-shell-scripts-sensitive-to-encoding-and-line-endings,8,"
Yes. Bash scripts are sensitive to line-endings, both in the script itself and in data it processes. They should have Unix-style line-endings, i.e., each line is terminated with a Line Feed character (decimal 10, hex 0A in ASCII).
DOS/Windows line endings in the script
With Windows or DOS-style line endings , each line is terminated with a Carriage Return followed by a Line Feed character. You can see this otherwise invisible character in the output of cat -v yourfile:
$ cat -v yourfile
#!/bin/bash^M
^M
cd ""src""^M
npm install^M
^M
cd ..^M
./tools/nwjs-sdk-v0.17.3-osx-x64/nwjs.app/Contents/MacOS/nwjs ""src"" &^M

In this case, the carriage return (^M in caret notation or \r in C escape notation) is not treated as whitespace.  Bash interprets the first line after the shebang (consisting of a single carriage return character) as the name of a command/program to run.

Since there is no command named ^M, it prints : command not found
Since there is no directory named ""src""^M (or src^M), it prints : No such file or directory
It passes install^M instead of install as an argument to npm which causes npm to complain.

DOS/Windows line endings in input data
Like above, if you have an input file with carriage returns:
hello^M
world^M

then it will look completely normal in editors and when writing it to screen, but tools may produce strange results. For example, grep will fail to find lines that are obviously there:
$ grep 'hello$' file.txt || grep -x ""hello"" file.txt
(no match because the line actually ends in ^M)

Appended text will instead overwrite the line because the carriage returns moves the cursor to the start of the line:
$ sed -e 's/$/!/' file.txt
!ello
!orld

String comparison will seem to fail, even though strings appear to be the same when writing to screen:
$ a=""hello""; read b < file.txt
$ if [[ ""$a"" = ""$b"" ]]
  then echo ""Variables are equal.""
  else echo ""Sorry, $a is not equal to $b""
  fi

Sorry, hello is not equal to hello

Solutions
The solution is to convert the file to use Unix-style line endings. There are a number of ways this can be accomplished:

This can be done using the dos2unix program:
dos2unix filename


Open the file in a capable text editor (Sublime, Notepad++, not Notepad) and configure it to save files with Unix line endings, e.g., with Vim, run the following command before (re)saving:
:set fileformat=unix


If you have a version of the sed utility that supports the -i or --in-place option, e.g., GNU sed, you could run the following command to strip trailing carriage returns:
sed -i 's/\r$//' filename

With other versions of sed, you could use output redirection to write to a new file. Be sure to use a different filename for the redirection target (it can be renamed later).
sed 's/\r$//' filename > filename.unix


Similarly, the tr translation filter can be used to delete unwanted characters from its input:
tr -d '\r' <filename >filename.unix



Cygwin Bash
With the Bash port for Cygwin, there’s a custom igncr option that can be set to ignore the Carriage Return in line endings (presumably because many of its users use native Windows programs to edit their text files).
This can be enabled for the current shell by running set -o igncr.
Setting this option applies only to the current shell process so it can be useful when sourcing files with extraneous carriage returns.  If you regularly encounter shell scripts with DOS line endings and want this option to be set permanently, you could set an environment variable called SHELLOPTS (all capital letters) to include igncr. This environment variable is used by Bash to set shell options when it starts (before reading any startup files).
Useful utilities
The file utility is useful for quickly seeing which line endings are used in a text file. Here’s what it prints for for each file type:

Unix line endings: Bourne-Again shell script, ASCII text executable
Mac line endings: Bourne-Again shell script, ASCII text executable, with CR line terminators
DOS line endings: Bourne-Again shell script, ASCII text executable, with CRLF line terminators

The GNU version of the cat utility has a -v, --show-nonprinting option that displays non-printing characters.
The dos2unix utility is specifically written for converting text files between Unix, Mac and DOS line endings.
Useful links
Wikipedia has an excellent article covering the many different ways of marking the end of a line of text, the history of such encodings and how newlines are treated in different operating systems, programming languages and Internet protocols (e.g., FTP).
Files with classic Mac OS line endings
With Classic Mac OS (pre-OS X), each line was terminated with a Carriage Return (decimal 13, hex 0D in ASCII). If a script file was saved with such line endings, Bash would only see one long line like so:
#!/bin/bash^M^Mcd ""src""^Mnpm install^M^Mcd ..^M./tools/nwjs-sdk-v0.17.3-osx-x64/nwjs.app/Contents/MacOS/nwjs ""src"" &^M

Since this single long line begins with an octothorpe (#), Bash treats the line (and the whole file) as a single comment.
Note: In 2001, Apple launched Mac OS X which was based on the BSD-derived NeXTSTEP operating system. As a result, OS X also uses Unix-style LF-only line endings and since then, text files terminated with a CR have become extremely rare. Nevertheless, I think it’s worthwhile to show how Bash would attempt to interpret such files.

On  JetBrains products (PyCharm, PHPStorm, IDEA, etc.),  you'll need to click  on CRLF/LF to toggle between the two types of line separators (\r\n and \n).

How can I squash my last X commits together into one commit using Git?

Use git rebase -i <after-this-commit> and replace ""pick"" on the second and subsequent commits with ""squash"" or ""fixup"", as described in the manual.
In this example, <after-this-commit> is either the SHA1 hash or the relative location from the HEAD of the current branch from which commits are analyzed for the rebase command. For example, if the user wishes to view 5 commits from the current HEAD in the past the command is git rebase -i HEAD~5. 
",2265,"
You can do this fairly easily without git rebase or git merge --squash. In this example, we'll squash the last 3 commits.
If you want to write the new commit message from scratch, this suffices:
git reset --soft HEAD~3 &&
git commit

If you want to start editing the new commit message with a concatenation of the existing commit messages (i.e. similar to what a pick/squash/squash/…/squash git rebase -i instruction list would start you with), then you need to extract those messages and pass them to git commit:
git reset --soft HEAD~3 && 
git commit --edit -m""$(git log --format=%B --reverse HEAD..HEAD@{1})""

Both of those methods squash the last three commits into a single new commit in the same way. The soft reset just re-points HEAD to the last commit that you do not want to squash. Neither the index nor the working tree are touched by the soft reset, leaving the index in the desired state for your new commit (i.e. it already has all the changes from the commits that you are about to “throw away”).

I'm using Sass (.scss) for my current project. 
Following example:

In the sample above I'm talking about this:

    background:blue;

How can I nest this inside container with Sass?
","288,831",352,47,sass ,https://stackoverflow.com/questions/11084757/sass-scss-nesting-and-multiple-classes,4,"
You can use the parent selector reference &, it will be replaced by the parent selector after compilation:
For your example:
.container {
    background:red;
    &.desc{
       background:blue;
    }
}

/* compiles to: */
.container {
    background: red;
}
.container.desc {
    background: blue;
}

The & will completely resolve, so if your parent selector is nested itself, the nesting will be resolved before replacing the &.  
This notation is most often used to write pseudo-elements and -classes:
.element{
    &:hover{ ... }
    &:nth-child(1){ ... }
}

However, you can place the & at virtually any position you like*, so the following is possible too:
.container {
    background:red;
    #id &{
       background:blue;
    }
}

/* compiles to: */
.container {
    background: red;
}
#id .container {
    background: blue;
}

However be aware, that this somehow breaks your nesting structure and thus may increase the effort of finding a specific rule in your stylesheet.
*: No other characters than whitespaces are allowed in front of the &. So you cannot do a direct concatenation of selector+& - #id& would throw an error. 
",600,"
If that is the case, I think you need to use a better way of creating a class name or a class name convention. For example, like you said you want the .container class to have different color according to a specific usage or appearance. You can do this: 
SCSS
.container {
  background: red;

  &--desc {
    background: blue;
  }

  // or you can do a more specific name
  &--blue {
    background: blue;
  }

  &--red {
    background: red;
  }
}

CSS
.container {
  background: red;
}

.container--desc {
  background: blue;
}

.container--blue {
  background: blue;
}

.container--red {
  background: red;

For anyone interested in reading more about it, Stack Overflow user kangax has written an incredibly in-depth blog post about the delete statement on their blog, Understanding delete. It is highly recommended.
",8520,"
Objects in JavaScript can be thought of as maps between keys and values. The delete operator is used to remove these keys, more commonly known as object properties, one at a time.


var obj = {
  myProperty: 1    
}
console.log(obj.hasOwnProperty('myProperty')) // true
delete obj.myProperty
console.log(obj.hasOwnProperty('myProperty')) // false



The delete operator does not directly free memory, and it differs from simply assigning the value of null or undefined to a property, in that the property itself is removed from the object. Note that if the value of a deleted property was a reference type (an object), and another part of your program still holds a reference to that object, then that object will, of course, not be garbage collected until all references to it have disappeared.
delete will only work on properties whose descriptor marks them as configurable.

Given a list of lists t,

Here is the corresponding function:
flatten = lambda t: [item for sublist in t for item in sublist]

As evidence, you can use the timeit module in the standard library:
$ python -mtimeit -s't=[[1,2,3],[4,5,6], [7], [8,9]]*99' '[item for sublist in t for item in sublist]'

1000 loops, best of 3: 1.1 msec per loop

Explanation: the shortcuts based on + (including the implied use in sum) are, of necessity, O(T**2) when there are T sublists -- as the intermediate result list keeps getting longer, at each step a new intermediate result list object gets allocated, and all the items in the previous intermediate result must be copied over (as well as a few new ones added at the end). So, for simplicity and without actual loss of generality, say you have T sublists of k items each: the first k items are copied back and forth T-1 times, the second k items T-2 times, and so on; total number of copies is k times the sum of x for x from 1 to T excluded, i.e., k * (T**2)/2.
The list comprehension just generates one list, once, and copies each item over (from its original place of residence to the result list) also exactly once.

Update: As of August 2020, you can use replaceAll
as shown here:
let result = ""1 abc 2 abc 3"".replaceAll(""abc"", ""xyz"");
// `result` is ""1 xyz 2 xyz 3""


For older browsers:
Note: Don't use the following solution in performance critical code.
As an alternative to regular expressions for a simple literal string, you could use
str = ""Test abc test test abc test..."".split(""abc"").join("""");

The general pattern is
str.split(search).join(replacement)

This used to be faster in some cases than using replaceAll and a regular expression, but that doesn't seem to be the case anymore in modern browsers.
Benchmark: https://jsperf.com/replace-all-vs-split-join
Conclusion: If you have a performance critical use case (e.g processing hundreds of strings), use the Regexp method. But for most typical use cases, this is well worth not having to worry about special characters.
",1843,"
As of August 2020, greenfield browsers have support for the String.replaceAll() method defined by the ECMAScript 2021 language specification. For older/legacy browser support, the below still applies.

str = str.replace(/abc/g, '');

In response to comment:
var find = 'abc';
var re = new RegExp(find, 'g');

str = str.replace(re, '');

In response to Click Upvote's comment, you could simplify it even more:
function replaceAll(str, find, replace) {
  return str.replace(new RegExp(find, 'g'), replace);
}

Note: Regular expressions contain special (meta) characters, and as such it is dangerous to blindly pass an argument in the find function above without pre-processing it to escape those characters.  This is covered in the Mozilla Developer Network's JavaScript Guide on Regular Expressions, where they present the following utility function (which has changed at least twice since this answer was originally written, so make sure to check the MDN site for potential updates):
function escapeRegExp(string) {
  return string.replace(/[.*+\-?^${}()|[\]\\]/g, '\\$&'); // $& means the whole matched string
}

So in order to make the replaceAll() function above safer, it could be modified to the following if you also include escapeRegExp:
function replaceAll(str, find, replace) {
  return str.replace(new RegExp(escapeRegExp(find), 'g'), replace);
}

How can I do this using the new forEach method in JavaScript? I've tried return;, return false; and break. break crashes and return does nothing but continue iteration.
","1,170,992",1689,242,javascript arrays foreach ,https://stackoverflow.com/questions/2641347/short-circuit-array-foreach-like-calling-break,30,"
There's no built-in ability to break in forEach. To interrupt execution you would have to throw an exception of some sort. eg.


var BreakException = {};

try {
  [1, 2, 3].forEach(function(el) {
    console.log(el);
    if (el === 2) throw BreakException;
  });
} catch (e) {
  if (e !== BreakException) throw e;
}



JavaScript exceptions aren't terribly pretty. A traditional for loop might be more appropriate if you really need to break inside it. 
Use Array#some
Instead, use Array#some:


[1, 2, 3].some(function(el) {
  console.log(el);
  return el === 2;
});



This works because some returns true as soon as any of the callbacks, executed in array order, return true, short-circuiting the execution of the rest.
some, its inverse every (which will stop on a return false), and forEach are all ECMAScript Fifth Edition methods which will need to be added to the Array.prototype on browsers where they're missing.
",2250,"
There is now an even better way to do this in ECMAScript2015 (aka ES6) using the new for of loop. For example, this code does not print the array elements after the number 5:

for (let el of arr) {
  console.log(el);
  if (el === 5) {

From the docs: 

Both for...in and for...of statements iterate over something. The main difference between them is in what they iterate over. The for...in statement iterates over the enumerable properties of an object, in original insertion order. The for...of statement iterates over data that iterable object defines to be iterated over.

Need the index in the iteration? You can use Array.entries():

Half-Open
Date-time work commonly employs the ""Half-Open"" approach to defining a span of time. The beginning is inclusive while the ending is exclusive. So a week starting on a Monday runs up to, but does not include, the following Monday.
java.time
Java 8 and later comes with the java.time framework built-in. Supplants the old troublesome classes including java.util.Date/.Calendar and SimpleDateFormat. Inspired by the successful Joda-Time library. Defined by JSR 310. Extended by the ThreeTen-Extra project.
An Instant is a moment on the timeline in UTC with nanosecond resolution.
Instant
Convert your java.util.Date objects to Instant objects.
Instant start = myJUDateStart.toInstant();
Instant stop = …

If getting java.sql.Timestamp objects through JDBC from a database, convert to java.time.Instant in a similar way. A java.sql.Timestamp is already in UTC so no need to worry about time zones.
Instant start = mySqlTimestamp.toInstant() ;
Instant stop = …

Get the current moment for comparison.
Instant now = Instant.now();

Compare using the methods isBefore, isAfter, and equals.
Boolean containsNow = ( ! now.isBefore( start ) ) && ( now.isBefore( stop ) ) ;

LocalDate
Perhaps you want to work with only the date, not the time-of-day.
The LocalDate class represents a date-only value, without time-of-day and without time zone.
LocalDate start = LocalDate.of( 2016 , 1 , 1 ) ;
LocalDate stop = LocalDate.of( 2016 , 1 , 23 ) ;

To get the current date, specify a time zone. At any given moment, today’s date varies by time zone. For example, a new day dawns earlier in Paris than in Montréal.
LocalDate today = LocalDate.now( ZoneId.of( ""America/Montreal"" ) );

We can use the isEqual, isBefore, and isAfter methods to compare. In date-time work we commonly use the Half-Open approach where the beginning of a span of time is inclusive while the ending is exclusive.
Boolean containsToday = ( ! today.isBefore( start ) ) && ( today.isBefore( stop ) ) ;

Interval
If you chose to add the ThreeTen-Extra library to your project, you could use the Interval class to define a span of time. That class offers methods to test if the interval contains, abuts, encloses, or overlaps  other date-times/intervals.
The Interval class works on Instant objects. The Instant class represents a moment on the timeline in UTC with a resolution of nanoseconds (up to nine (9) digits of a decimal fraction).
We can adjust the LocalDate into a specific moment, the first moment of the day, by specifying a time zone to get a ZonedDateTime. From there we can get back to UTC by extracting a Instant.
ZoneId z = ZoneId.of( ""America/Montreal"" );
Interval interval = 
    Interval.of( 
        start.atStartOfDay( z ).toInstant() , 
        stop.atStartOfDay( z ).toInstant() );
Instant now = Instant.now();
Boolean containsNow = interval.contains( now );


About java.time
The java.time framework is built into Java 8 and later. These classes supplant the troublesome old legacy date-time classes such as java.util.Date, Calendar, & SimpleDateFormat.
The Joda-Time project, now in maintenance mode, advises migration to the java.time classes.
To learn more, see the Oracle Tutorial. And search Stack Overflow for many examples and explanations. Specification is JSR 310.
Where to obtain the java.time classes?

Java SE 8 and SE 9 and later
Built-in.
Part of the standard Java API with a bundled implementation.
Java 9 adds some minor features and fixes.
Java SE 6 and SE 7
Much of the java.time functionality is back-ported to Java 6 & 7 in ThreeTen-Backport.
Android
The ThreeTenABP project adapts ThreeTen-Backport (mentioned above) for Android specifically.
See How to use….

The ThreeTen-Extra project extends java.time with additional classes. This project is a proving ground for possible future additions to java.time. You may find some useful classes here such as Interval, YearWeek, YearQuarter, and more.

The primitive types (number, string, etc.) are passed by value, but objects are unknown, because they can be both passed-by-value (in case we consider that a variable holding an object is in fact a reference to the object) and passed-by-reference (when we consider that the variable to the object holds the object itself).

It's interesting in JavaScript. Consider this example:


function changeStuff(a, b, c)
{
  a = a * 10;
  b.item = ""changed"";
  c = {item: ""changed""};
}

var num = 10;

var obj2 = {item: ""unchanged""};

changeStuff(num, obj1, obj2);

console.log(num);
console.log(obj1.item);
console.log(obj2.item);



This produces the output:

If obj1 was not a reference at all, then changing obj1.item would have no effect on the obj1 outside of the function.
If the argument was a proper reference, then everything would have changed. num would be 100, and obj2.item would read ""changed"".

Instead, the situation is that the item passed in is passed by value. But the item that is passed by value is itself a reference.
Technically, this is called call-by-sharing.
In practical terms, this means that if you change the parameter itself (as with num and obj2), that won't affect the item that was fed into the parameter. But if you change the INTERNALS of the parameter, that will propagate back up (as with obj1).

It's not a matter of security. The HTTP protocol defines GET-type requests as being idempotent, while POSTs may have side effects. In plain English, that means that GET is used for viewing something, without changing it, while POST is used for changing something. For example, a search page should use GET, while a form that changes your password should use POST.
Also, note that PHP confuses the concepts a bit. A POST request gets input from the query string and through the request body. A GET request just gets input from the query string. So a POST request is a superset of a GET request; you can use $_GET in a POST request, and it may even make sense to have parameters with the same name in $_POST and $_GET that mean different things.
For example, let's say you have a form for editing an article. The article-id may be in the query string (and, so, available through $_GET['id']), but let's say that you want to change the article-id. The new id may then be present in the request body ($_POST['id']). OK, perhaps that's not the best example, but I hope it illustrates the difference between the two.
",269,"
When the user enters information in a form and clicks Submit , there are two ways the information can be sent from the browser to the server: in the URL, or within the body of the HTTP request.
The GET method, which was used in the example earlier, appends name/value pairs to the URL. Unfortunately, the length of a URL is limited, so this method only works if there are only a few parameters. The URL could be truncated if the form uses a large number of parameters, or if the parameters contain large amounts of data. Also, parameters passed on the URL are visible in the address field of the browser not the best place for a password to be displayed.
The alternative to the GET method is the POST method. This method packages the name/value pairs inside the body of the HTTP request, which makes for a cleaner URL and imposes no size limitations on the forms output. It is also more secure.

I'd like to accomplish this without having the text and the background as two separate elements.
When trying:

Here's an article from css3.info, Opacity, RGBA and compromise (2007-06-03).

In Firefox 3 and Safari 3, you can use RGBA like Georg Schölly mentioned.
A little known trick is that you can use it in Internet Explorer as well using the gradient filter.
background-color: rgba(0, 255, 0, 0.5);
filter: progid:DXImageTransform.Microsoft.Gradient(GradientType=0, StartColorStr='#7F00FF00', EndColorStr='#7F00FF00');

The first hex number defines the alpha value of the color.
Full solution all browsers:
.alpha60 {
    /* Fallback for web browsers that doesn't support RGBa */
    background: rgb(0, 0, 0) transparent;
    /* RGBa with 0.6 opacity */
    background: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.6);
    /* For IE 5.5 - 7*/
    filter:progid:DXImageTransform.Microsoft.gradient(startColorstr=#99000000, endColorstr=#99000000);
    /* For IE 8*/
    -ms-filter: ""progid:DXImageTransform.Microsoft.gradient(startColorstr=#99000000, endColorstr=#99000000)"";
}

This is from CSS background transparency without affecting child elements, through RGBa and filters.

How can I figure out the size of a file, in bytes?
#include <stdio.h>

unsigned int fsize(char* file){
  //what goes here?
}

","128,926",141,35,c file io filesize ,https://stackoverflow.com/questions/8236/how-do-you-determine-the-size-of-a-file-in-c,14,"
Based on NilObject's code:
#include <sys/stat.h>
#include <sys/types.h>

off_t fsize(const char *filename) {
    struct stat st; 

    if (stat(filename, &st) == 0)
        return st.st_size;

    return -1; 
}

Changes:

Made the filename argument a const char.
Corrected the struct stat definition, which was missing the variable name.
Returns -1 on error instead of 0, which would be ambiguous for an empty file. off_t is a signed type so this is possible.

If you want fsize() to print a message on error, you can use this:
#include <sys/stat.h>
#include <sys/types.h>
#include <string.h>
#include <stdio.h>
#include <errno.h>

off_t fsize(const char *filename) {
    struct stat st;

    if (stat(filename, &st) == 0)
        return st.st_size;

    fprintf(stderr, ""Cannot determine size of %s: %s\n"",
            filename, strerror(errno));

    return -1;
}

On 32-bit systems you should compile this with the option -D_FILE_OFFSET_BITS=64, otherwise off_t will only hold values up to 2 GB. See the ""Using LFS"" section of Large File Support in Linux for details.
",146,"
Don't use int. Files over 2 gigabytes in size are common as dirt these days
Don't use unsigned int. Files over 4 gigabytes in size are common as some slightly-less-common dirt
IIRC the standard library defines off_t as an unsigned 64 bit integer, which is what everyone should be using. We can redefine that to be 128 bits in a few years when we start having 16 exabyte files hanging around.
If you're on windows, you should use GetFileSizeEx - it actually uses a signed 64 bit integer, so they'll start hitting problems with 8 exabyte files. Foolish Microsoft! :-)

You need to install CURL support for php.
In Ubuntu you can install it via
sudo apt-get install php5-curl

If you're using apt-get then you won't need to edit any PHP configuration, but you will need to restart your Apache.
sudo /etc/init.d/apache2 restart

If you're still getting issues, then try and use phpinfo() to make sure that CURL is listed as installed. (If it isn't, then you may need to open another question, asking why your packages aren't installing.)
There is an installation manual in the PHP CURL documentation.

305,5357601,10752,What is the difference between integration and unit tests?,"
I know the so-called textbook definition of unit tests and integration tests.  What I am curious about is when it is time to write unit tests... I will write them to cover as many sets of classes as possible.
For example, if I have a Word class, I will write some unit tests for the Word class.  Then, I begin writing my Sentence class, and when it needs to interact with the Word class, I will often write my unit tests such that they test both Sentence and Word... at least in the places where they interact.
Have these tests essentially become integration tests because they now test the integration of these 2 classes, or is it just a unit test that spans 2 classes?
In general, because of this uncertain line, I will rarely actually write integration tests... or is my using the finished product to see if all the pieces work properly the actual integration tests, even though they are manual and rarely repeated beyond the scope of each individual feature?
Am I misunderstanding integration tests, or is there really just very little difference between integration and unit tests?
","52,988",311,164,unit-testing integration-testing ,https://stackoverflow.com/questions/10752/what-is-the-difference-between-integration-and-unit-tests,20,-,-,"
The key difference, to me, is that integration tests reveal if a feature is working or is broken, since they stress the code in a scenario close to reality. They invoke one or more software methods or features and test if they act as expected.
On the opposite, a Unit test testing a single method relies on the (often wrong) assumption that the rest of the software is correctly working, because it explicitly mocks every dependency.
Hence, when a unit test for a method implementing some feature is green, it does not mean the feature is working.
Say you have a method somewhere like this:
public SomeResults DoSomething(someInput) {
  var someResult = [Do your job with someInput];
  Log.TrackTheFactYouDidYourJob();
  return someResults;
}

DoSomething is very important to your customer: it's a feature, the only thing that matters. That's why you usually write a Cucumber specification asserting it: you wish to verify and communicate the feature is working or not.
Feature: To be able to do something
  In order to do something
  As someone
  I want the system to do this thing

Scenario: A sample one
  Given this situation
  When I do something
  Then what I get is what I was expecting for

No doubt: if the test passes, you can assert you are delivering a working feature. This is what you can call Business Value.
If you want to write a unit test for DoSomething you should pretend (using some mocks) that the rest of the classes and methods are working (that is: that, all dependencies the method is using are correctly working) and assert your method is working.
In practice, you do something like:
public SomeResults DoSomething(someInput) {
  var someResult = [Do your job with someInput];
  FakeAlwaysWorkingLog.TrackTheFactYouDidYourJob(); // Using a mock Log
  return someResults;
}

You can do this with Dependency Injection, or some Factory Method or any Mock Framework or just extending the class under test.
Suppose there's a bug in Log.DoSomething().
Fortunately, the Gherkin spec will find it and your end-to-end tests will fail.
The feature won't work, because Log is broken, not because [Do your job with someInput] is not doing its job. And, by the way, [Do your job with someInput] is the sole responsibility for that method.
Also, suppose Log is used in 100 other features, in 100 other methods of 100 other classes.
Yep, 100 features will fail. But, fortunately, 100 end-to-end tests are failing as well and revealing the problem. And, yes: they are telling the truth.
It's very useful information: I know I have a broken product. It's also very confusing information: it tells me nothing about where the problem is. It communicates me the symptom, not the root cause.
Yet, DoSomething's unit test is green, because it's using a fake Log, built to never break. And, yes: it's clearly lying. It's communicating a broken feature is working. How can it be useful?
(If DoSomething()'s unit test fails, be sure: [Do your job with someInput] has some bugs.)
Suppose this is a system with a broken class:

A single bug will break several features, and several integration tests will fail.

On the other hand, the same bug will break just one unit test.

Now, compare the two scenarios.
The same bug will break just one unit test.

All your features using the broken Log are red
All your unit tests are green, only the unit test for Log is red

Actually, unit tests for all modules using a broken feature are green because, by using mocks, they removed dependencies. In other words, they run in an ideal, completely fictional world. And this is the only way to isolate bugs and seek them. Unit testing means mocking. If you aren't mocking, you aren't unit testing.
The difference
Integration tests tell what's not working. But they are of no use in guessing where the problem could be.
Unit tests are the sole tests that tell you where exactly the bug is. To draw this information, they must run the method in a mocked environment, where all other dependencies are supposed to correctly work.
That's why I think that your sentence ""Or is it just a unit test that spans 2 classes"" is somehow displaced. A unit test should never span 2 classes.
This reply is basically a summary of what I wrote here: Unit tests lie, that's why I love them.

306,1080442,221925,Creating a byte array from a stream,"
What is the prefered method for creating a byte array from an input stream? 
Here is my current solution with .NET 3.5. 
Stream s;
byte[] b;

using (BinaryReader br = new BinaryReader(s))
{
    b = br.ReadBytes((int)s.Length);
}

Is it still a better idea to read and write chunks of the stream?
","914,126",940,235,c# .net-3.5 inputstream ,https://stackoverflow.com/questions/221925/creating-a-byte-array-from-a-stream,16,"
It really depends on whether or not you can trust s.Length. For many streams, you just don't know how much data there will be. In such cases - and before .NET 4 - I'd use code like this:
public static byte[] ReadFully(Stream input)
{
    byte[] buffer = new byte[16*1024];
    using (MemoryStream ms = new MemoryStream())
    {
        int read;
        while ((read = input.Read(buffer, 0, buffer.Length)) > 0)
        {
            ms.Write(buffer, 0, read);
        }
        return ms.ToArray();
    }
}

With .NET 4 and above, I'd use Stream.CopyTo, which is basically equivalent to the loop in my code - create the MemoryStream, call stream.CopyTo(ms) and then return ms.ToArray(). Job done.
I should perhaps explain why my answer is longer than the others. Stream.Read doesn't guarantee that it will read everything it's asked for. If you're reading from a network stream, for example, it may read one packet's worth and then return, even if there will be more data soon. BinaryReader.Read will keep going until the end of the stream or your specified size, but you still have to know the size to start with.
The above method will keep reading (and copying into a MemoryStream) until it runs out of data. It then asks the MemoryStream to return a copy of the data in an array. If you know the size to start with - or think you know the size, without being sure - you can construct the MemoryStream to be that size to start with. Likewise you can put a check at the end, and if the length of the stream is the same size as the buffer (returned by MemoryStream.GetBuffer) then you can just return the buffer. So the above code isn't quite optimised, but will at least be correct. It doesn't assume any responsibility for closing the stream - the caller should do that.
See this article for more info (and an alternative implementation).
",1325,"
While Jon's answer is correct, he is rewriting code that already exists in CopyTo. So for .Net 4 use Sandip's solution, but for previous version of .Net use Jon's answer. Sandip's code would be improved by use of ""using"" as exceptions in CopyTo are, in many situations, quite likely and would leave the MemoryStream not disposed.
public static byte[] ReadFully(Stream input)
{
    using (MemoryStream ms = new MemoryStream())
    {

There are actually several approaches to do this. Some require more overhead than others, and some are considered better than others.
In no particular order:

Use AJAX to get the data you need from the server.
Echo the data into the page somewhere, and use JavaScript to get the information from the DOM.
Echo the data directly to JavaScript.

In this post, we'll examine each of the above methods, and see the pros and cons of each, as well as how to implement them.
1. Use AJAX to get the data you need from the server
This method is considered the best, because your server side and client side scripts are completely separate.
Pros

Better separation between layers - If tomorrow you stop using PHP, and want to move to a servlet, a REST API, or some other service, you don't have to change much of the JavaScript code.
More readable - JavaScript is JavaScript, PHP is PHP. Without mixing the two, you get more readable code on both languages.
Allows for asynchronous data transfer - Getting the information from PHP might be time/resources expensive. Sometimes you just don't want to wait for the information, load the page, and have the information reach whenever.
Data is not directly found on the markup - This means that your markup is kept clean of any additional data, and only JavaScript sees it.

Cons

Latency - AJAX creates an HTTP request, and HTTP requests are carried over network and have network latencies.
State - Data fetched via a separate HTTP request won't include any information from the HTTP request that fetched the HTML document. You may need this information (e.g., if the HTML document is generated in response to a form submission) and, if you do, will have to transfer it across somehow. If you have ruled out embedding the data in the page (which you have if you are using this technique) then that limits you to cookies/sessions which may be subject to race conditions.

Implementation Example
With AJAX, you need two pages, one is where PHP generates the output, and the second is where JavaScript gets that output:
get-data.php
/* Do some operation here, like talk to the database, the file-session
 * The world beyond, limbo, the city of shimmers, and Canada.
 *
 * AJAX generally uses strings, but you can output JSON, HTML and XML as well.
 * It all depends on the Content-type header that you send with your AJAX
 * request. */

echo json_encode(42); // In the end, you need to echo the result.
                      // All data should be json_encode()d.

                      // You can json_encode() any value in PHP, arrays, strings,
                      //even objects.


index.php (or whatever the actual page is named like)
<!-- snip -->
<script>
    function reqListener () {
      console.log(this.responseText);
    }

    var oReq = new XMLHttpRequest(); // New request object
    oReq.onload = function() {
        // This is where you handle what to do with the response.
        // The actual data is found on this.responseText
        alert(this.responseText); // Will alert: 42
    };
    oReq.open(""get"", ""get-data.php"", true);
    //                               ^ Don't block the rest of the execution.
    //                                 Don't wait until the request finishes to
    //                                 continue.
    oReq.send();
</script>
<!-- snip -->

The above combination of the two files will alert 42 when the file finishes loading.

2. Echo the data into the page somewhere, and use JavaScript to get the information from the DOM
This method is less preferable to AJAX, but it still has its advantages. It's still relatively separated between PHP and JavaScript in a sense that there is no PHP directly in the JavaScript.
Pros

Fast - DOM operations are often quick, and you can store and access a lot of data relatively quickly.

Cons

Potentially Unsemantic Markup - Usually, what happens is that you use some sort of <input type=hidden> to store the information, because it's easier to get the information out of inputNode.value, but doing so means that you have a meaningless element in your HTML. HTML has the <meta> element for data about the document, and HTML 5 introduces data-* attributes for data specifically for reading with JavaScript that can be associated with particular elements.
Dirties up the Source - Data that PHP generates is outputted directly to the HTML source, meaning that you get a bigger and less focused HTML source.
Harder to get structured data - Structured data will have to be valid HTML, otherwise you'll have to escape and convert strings yourself.
Tightly couples PHP to your data logic - Because PHP is used in presentation, you can't separate the two cleanly.

Implementation Example
With this, the idea is to create some sort of element which will not be displayed to the user, but is visible to JavaScript.
index.php
<!-- snip -->
<div id=""dom-target"" style=""display: none;"">
    <?php
        $output = ""42""; // Again, do some operation, get the output.
        echo htmlspecialchars($output); /* You have to escape because the result
                                           will not be valid HTML otherwise. */
    ?>
</div>
<script>
    var div = document.getElementById(""dom-target"");
    var myData = div.textContent;
</script>
<!-- snip -->

3. Echo the data directly to JavaScript
This is probably the easiest to understand.
Pros

Very easily implemented - It takes very little to implement this, and understand.
Does not dirty source - Variables are outputted directly to JavaScript, so the DOM is not affected.

Cons

Tightly couples PHP to your data logic - Because PHP is used in presentation, you can't separate the two cleanly.

Implementation Example
Implementation is relatively straightforward:
<!-- snip -->
<script>
    var data = <?php echo json_encode(""42"", JSON_HEX_TAG); ?>; // Don't forget the extra semicolon!
</script>
<!-- snip -->

Good luck!
",898,"
I'm going to try a simpler answer:
Explanation of the problem
First, let's understand the flow of events when a page is served from our server:

First PHP is run, it generates the HTML that is served to the client.
Then, the HTML is delivered to the client, after PHP is done with it, I'd like to emphasize that once the code leaves the server - PHP is done with it and can no longer access it.
Then, the HTML with JavaScript reaches the client, which can execute JavaScript on that HTML.

So really, the core thing to remember here is that HTTP is stateless. Once a request left the server, the server can not touch it. So, that leaves our options to:

Send more requests from the client after the initial request is done.
Encode what the server had to say in the initial request.

Solutions
That's the core question you should be asking yourself is:
Am I writing a website or an application?
Websites are mainly page based, and the page load times needs to be as fast as possible (for example - Wikipedia). Web applications are more AJAX heavy and perform a lot of round trips to get the client fast information (for example - a stock dashboard).
Website
Sending more requests from the client after the initial request is done is slow as it requires more HTTP requests which have significant overhead. Moreover, it requires asynchronousity as making an AJAX request requires a handler for when it's complete.
I would not recommend making another request unless your site is an application for getting that information from the server.
You want fast response times which have a huge impact on conversion and load times. Making Ajax requests is slow for the initial uptime in this case and unneeded.
You have two ways to tackle the issue

Set a cookie - cookies are headers sent in HTTP requests that both the server and client can read.
Encode the variable as JSON - JSON looks very close to JavaScript objects and most JSON objects are valid JavaScript variables.

Setting a cookie is really not very difficult, you just assign it a value:
setcookie(""MyCookie"", $value); // Sets the cookie to the value, remember, do not
                               // Set it with HTTP only to true.

Then, you can read it with JavaScript using document.cookie:
Here is a short hand rolled parser, but the answer I linked to right above this has better tested ones:
var cookies = document.cookie.split("";"").
    map(function(el){ return el.split(""=""); }).
    reduce(function(prev,cur){ prev[cur[0]] = cur[1];return prev },{});

cookies[""MyCookie""] // Value set with PHP.

Cookies are good for a little data. This is what tracking services often do.
Once we have more data, we can encode it with JSON inside a JavaScript variable instead:
<script>
    var myServerData = <?=json_encode($value)?>; // Don't forget to sanitize
                                                 //server data
</script>

Assuming $value is json_encodeable on the PHP side (it usually is). This technique is what Stack Overflow does with its chat for example (only using .NET instead of PHP).
Application
If you're writing an application - suddenly the initial load time isn't always as important as the ongoing performance of the application, and it starts to pay off to load data and code separately.
My answer here explains how to load data using AJAX in JavaScript:
function callback(data){
    // What do I do with the response?
}

var httpRequest = new XMLHttpRequest;
httpRequest.onreadystatechange = function(){
    if (httpRequest.readyState === 4) { // Request is done
        if (httpRequest.status === 200) { // successfully
            callback(httpRequest.responseText); // We're calling our method
        }
    }
};
httpRequest.open('GET', ""/echo/json"");
httpRequest.send();

Or with jQuery:
$.get(""/your/url"").done(function(data){
    // What do I do with the data?
});

Now, the server just needs to contain a /your/url route/file that contains code that grabs the data and does something with it, in your case:
<$php
     ...
     $val = myService->getValue(); // Makes an API and database call
     echo json_encode($val); // Write it to the output
 $>

This way, our JavaScript file asks for the data and shows it rather than asking for code or for layout. This is cleaner and starts to pay off as the application gets higher. It's also better separation of concerns and it allows testing the client side code without any server side technology involved which is another plus.
Postscript: You have to be very aware of XSS attack vectors when you inject anything from PHP to JavaScript. It's very hard to escape values properly and it's context sensitive. If you're unsure how to deal with XSS, or unaware of it - please read this OWASP article, this one and this question.

the issue here is that their Hello World Program is showing up then it would immediately close.
  why is that?

Because it's finished. When console applications have completed executing and return from their main method, the associated console window automatically closes. This is expected behavior.
If you want to keep it open for debugging purposes, you'll need to instruct the computer to wait for a key press before ending the app and closing the window.
The Console.ReadLine method is one way of doing that. Adding this line to the end of your code (just before the return statement) will cause the application to wait for you to press a key before exiting.
Alternatively, you could start the application without the debugger attached by pressing Ctrl+F5 from within the Visual Studio environment, but this has the obvious disadvantage of preventing you from using the debugging features, which you probably want at your disposal when writing an application.
The best compromise is probably to call the Console.ReadLine method only when debugging the application by wrapping it in a preprocessor directive. Something like:
#if DEBUG
    Console.WriteLine(""Press enter to close..."");
    Console.ReadLine();
#endif

You might also want the window to stay open if an uncaught exception was thrown. To do that you can put the Console.ReadLine(); in a finally block:
#if DEBUG
    try
    {
        //...
    }
    finally
    {
        Console.WriteLine(""Press enter to close..."");
        Console.ReadLine();
    }
#endif

",271,"
Instead of using
Console.Readline()
Console.Read()
Console.ReadKey()

you can run your program using Ctrl+F5 (if you are in Visual Studio). Then Visual Studio will keep the console window open, until you press a key.
Note: You cannot debug your code in this approach.

I want to get the filename (without extension) and the extension separately.
The best solution I found so far is:

This is wrong because it doesn't work if the file name contains multiple . characters. If, let's say, I have a.b.js, it will consider a and b.js, instead of a.b and js.
It can be easily done in Python with
file, ext = os.path.splitext(path)

This depends a lot on what you mean by ""revert"".
Temporarily switch to a different commit
If you want to temporarily go back to it, fool around, then come back to where you are, all you have to do is check out the desired commit:
# This will detach your HEAD, that is, leave you with no branch checked out:
git checkout 0d1d7fc32

Or if you want to make commits while you're there, go ahead and make a new branch while you're at it:
git checkout -b old-state 0d1d7fc32

To go back to where you were, just check out the branch you were on again. (If you've made changes, as always when switching branches, you'll have to deal with them as appropriate. You could reset to throw them away; you could stash, checkout, stash pop to take them with you; you could commit them to a branch there if you want a branch there.)
Hard delete unpublished commits
If, on the other hand, you want to really get rid of everything you've done since then, there are two possibilities. One, if you haven't published any of these commits, simply reset:
# This will destroy any local modifications.
# Don't do it if you have uncommitted work you want to keep.
git reset --hard 0d1d7fc32

# Alternatively, if there's work to keep:
git stash
git reset --hard 0d1d7fc32
git stash pop
# This saves the modifications, then reapplies that patch after resetting.
# You could get merge conflicts, if you've modified things which were
# changed since the commit you reset to.

If you mess up, you've already thrown away your local changes, but you can at least get back to where you were before by resetting again.
Undo published commits with new commits
On the other hand, if you've published the work, you probably don't want to reset the branch, since that's effectively rewriting history. In that case, you could indeed revert the commits. With Git, revert has a very specific meaning: create a commit with the reverse patch to cancel it out. This way you don't rewrite any history.
# This will create three separate revert commits:
git revert a867b4af 25eee4ca 0766c053

# It also takes ranges. This will revert the last two commits:
git revert HEAD~2..HEAD

#Similarly, you can revert a range of commits using commit hashes (non inclusive of first hash):
git revert 0d1d7fc..a867b4a

# Reverting a merge commit
git revert -m 1 <merge_commit_sha>

# To get just one, you could use `rebase -i` to squash them afterwards
# Or, you could do it manually (be sure to do this at top level of the repo)
# get your index and work tree into the desired state, without changing HEAD:
git checkout 0d1d7fc32 .

# Then commit. Be sure and write a good message describing what you just did
git commit

The git-revert manpage actually covers a lot of this in its description. Another useful link is this git-scm.com section discussing git-revert.
If you decide you didn't want to revert after all, you can revert the revert (as described here) or reset back to before the revert (see the previous section).
You may also find this answer helpful in this case:
How can I move HEAD back to a previous location? (Detached head) & Undo commits
",10140,"
Lots of complicated and dangerous answers here, but it's actually easy:
git revert --no-commit 0766c053..HEAD
git commit

This will revert everything from the HEAD back to the commit hash, meaning it will recreate that commit state in the working tree as if every commit after 0766c053 had been walked back. You can then commit the current tree, and it will create a brand new commit essentially equivalent to the commit you ""reverted"" to.  
(The --no-commit flag lets git revert all the commits at once- otherwise you'll be prompted for a message for each commit in the range, littering your history with unnecessary new commits.)
This is a safe and easy way to rollback to a previous state. No history is destroyed, so it can be used for commits that have already been made public.

If it's the problem of the virtual keyboard, see the AndroidManifest.xml <activity> element documentation.

[[ has fewer surprises and is generally safer to use. But it is not portable - POSIX doesn't specify what it does and only some shells support it (beside bash, I heard ksh supports it too). For example, you can do 
[[ -e $b ]]

to test whether a file exists. But with [, you have to quote $b, because it splits the argument and expands things like ""a*"" (where [[ takes it literally). That has also to do with how [ can be an external program and receives its argument just normally like every other program (although it can also be a builtin, but then it still has not this special handling).
[[ also has some other nice features, like regular expression matching with =~ along with operators like they are known in C-like languages. Here is a good page about it: What is the difference between test, [ and [[ ? and Bash Tests
",644,"
Behavior differences
Some differences on Bash 4.3.11:

POSIX vs Bash extension:

[ is POSIX
[[ is a Bash extension¹

regular command vs magic

[ is just a regular command with a weird name.
] is just an argument of [ that prevents further arguments from being used.
Ubuntu 16.04 actually has an executable for it at /usr/bin/[ provided by coreutils, but the bash built-in version takes precedence.
Nothing is altered in the way that Bash parses the command.
In particular, < is redirection, && and || concatenate multiple commands, ( ) generates subshells unless escaped by \, and word expansion happens as usual.
[[ X ]] is a single construct that makes X be parsed magically. <, &&, || and () are treated specially, and word splitting rules are different.
There are also further differences like = and =~.
In Bashese: [ is a built-in command, and [[ is a keyword: https://askubuntu.com/questions/445749/whats-the-difference-between-shell-builtin-and-shell-keyword

<

[[ a < b ]]: lexicographical comparison
[ a \< b ]: Same as above. \ required or else does redirection like for any other command. Bash extension.
expr a \< b > /dev/null: POSIX equivalent², see: How to test strings for lexicographic less than or equal in Bash?

&& and ||

[[ a = a && b = b ]]: true, logical and
[ a = a && b = b ]: syntax error, && parsed as an AND command separator cmd1 && cmd2 
[ a = a -a b = b ]: equivalent, but deprecated by POSIX³
[ a = a ] && [ b = b ]: POSIX and reliable equivalent

(

[[ (a = a || a = b) && a = b ]]: false
[ ( a = a ) ]: syntax error, () is interpreted as a subshell
[ \( a = a -o a = b \) -a a = b ]: equivalent, but () is deprecated by POSIX
{ [ a = a ] || [ a = b ]; } && [ a = b ] POSIX equivalent⁵

word splitting and filename generation upon expansions (split+glob)

x='a b'; [[ $x = 'a b' ]]: true, quotes not needed
x='a b'; [ $x = 'a b' ]: syntax error, expands to [ a b = 'a b' ]
x='*'; [ $x = 'a b' ]: syntax error if there's more than one file in the current directory.
x='a b'; [ ""$x"" = 'a b' ]: POSIX equivalent

=

[[ ab = a? ]]: true, because it does pattern matching (* ? [ are magic). Does not glob expand to files in current directory.
[ ab = a? ]: a? glob expands. So may be true or false depending on the files in the current directory.
[ ab = a\? ]: false, not glob expansion
= and == are the same in both [ and [[, but == is a Bash extension.
case ab in (a?) echo match; esac: POSIX equivalent
[[ ab =~ 'ab?' ]]: false⁴, loses magic with ''
[[ ab? =~ 'ab?' ]]: true

=~

[[ ab =~ ab? ]]: true, POSIX extended regular expression match, ? does not glob expand
[ a =~ a ]: syntax error. No bash equivalent.
printf 'ab\n' | grep -Eq 'ab?': POSIX equivalent (single line data only)
awk 'BEGIN{exit !(ARGV[1] ~ ARGV[2])}' ab 'ab?': POSIX equivalent.


Recommendation: always use [].
There are POSIX equivalents for every [[ ]] construct I've seen.
If you use [[ ]] you:

³ and also fails for some values of a or b like ! or (.
⁴ in bash 3.2 and above and provided compatibility to bash 3.1 is not enabled (like with BASH_COMPAT=3.1)
⁵ though the grouping (here with the {...;} command group instead of (...) which would run an unnecessary subshell) is not necessary as the || and && shell operators (as opposed to the || and && [[...]] operators or the -o/-a [ operators) have equal precedence. So [ a = a ] || [ a = b ] && [ a = b ] would be equivalent.

While import is indeed part of ES6, it is unfortunately not yet supported in NodeJS by default, and has only very recently landed support in browsers.
See browser compat table on MDN and this Node issue.
From James M Snell's Update on ES6 Modules in Node.js (February 2017):

Work is in progress but it is going to take some time — We’re currently looking at around a year at least.

Until support shows up natively, you'll have to continue using classic require statements:
const express = require(""express"");

If you really want to use new ES6/7 features in NodeJS, you can compile it using Babel. Here's an example server.
",515,"
Unfortunately, Node.js doesn't support ES6's import yet.
To accomplish what you're trying to do (import the Express module), this code should suffice
var express = require(""express"");

Also, be sure you have Express installed by running
$ npm install express

See the Node.js Docs for more information about learning Node.js.

Update: As of August 2020, you can use replaceAll
as shown here:
let result = ""1 abc 2 abc 3"".replaceAll(""abc"", ""xyz"");
// `result` is ""1 xyz 2 xyz 3""


For older browsers:
Note: Don't use the following solution in performance critical code.
As an alternative to regular expressions for a simple literal string, you could use
str = ""Test abc test test abc test..."".split(""abc"").join("""");

The general pattern is
str.split(search).join(replacement)

This used to be faster in some cases than using replaceAll and a regular expression, but that doesn't seem to be the case anymore in modern browsers.
Benchmark: https://jsperf.com/replace-all-vs-split-join
Conclusion: If you have a performance critical use case (e.g processing hundreds of strings), use the Regexp method. But for most typical use cases, this is well worth not having to worry about special characters.
",1843,"
As of August 2020, greenfield browsers have support for the String.replaceAll() method defined by the ECMAScript 2021 language specification. For older/legacy browser support, the below still applies.

str = str.replace(/abc/g, '');

In response to comment:
var find = 'abc';
var re = new RegExp(find, 'g');

str = str.replace(re, '');

In response to Click Upvote's comment, you could simplify it even more:
function replaceAll(str, find, replace) {
  return str.replace(new RegExp(find, 'g'), replace);
}

Note: Regular expressions contain special (meta) characters, and as such it is dangerous to blindly pass an argument in the find function above without pre-processing it to escape those characters.  This is covered in the Mozilla Developer Network's JavaScript Guide on Regular Expressions, where they present the following utility function (which has changed at least twice since this answer was originally written, so make sure to check the MDN site for potential updates):
function escapeRegExp(string) {
  return string.replace(/[.*+\-?^${}()|[\]\\]/g, '\\$&'); // $& means the whole matched string
}

So in order to make the replaceAll() function above safer, it could be modified to the following if you also include escapeRegExp:
function replaceAll(str, find, replace) {
  return str.replace(new RegExp(escapeRegExp(find), 'g'), replace);
}

@Joel's answer is pretty close, but it will fail in the following cases:
// Whitespace strings:
IsNumeric(' ')    == true;
IsNumeric('\t\t') == true;

// Number literals:
IsNumeric(-1)  == false;
IsNumeric(0)   == false;
IsNumeric(1.1) == false;
IsNumeric(8e5) == false;

Some time ago I had to implement an IsNumeric function, to find out if a variable contained a numeric value, regardless of its type, it could be a String containing a numeric value (I had to consider also exponential notation, etc.), a Number object, virtually anything could be passed to that function, I couldn't make any type assumptions,  taking care of type coercion (eg. +true == 1; but true shouldn't be considered as ""numeric"").
I think is worth sharing this set of +30 unit tests made to numerous function implementations, and also share the one that passes all my tests:
function isNumeric(n) {
    return !isNaN(parseFloat(n)) && isFinite(n);
}

P.S. isNaN & isFinite have a confusing behavior due to forced conversion to number. In ES6, Number.isNaN & Number.isFinite would fix these issues. Keep that in mind when using them. 

Update : 
Here's how jQuery does it now (2.2-stable): 
isNumeric: function(obj) {
    var realStringObj = obj && obj.toString();
    return !jQuery.isArray(obj) && (realStringObj - parseFloat(realStringObj) + 1) >= 0;
}

Update :
Angular 4.3:
export function isNumeric(value: any): boolean {
    return !isNaN(value - parseFloat(value));
}

Arrrgh!  Don't listen to the regular expression answers.  RegEx is icky for this, and I'm not talking just performance.  It's so easy to make subtle, impossible to spot mistakes with your regular expression.  
If you can't use isNaN(), this should work much better:
function IsNumeric(input)
{
    return (input - 0) == input && (''+input).trim().length > 0;
}

Here's how it works:
The (input - 0) expression forces JavaScript to do type coercion on your input value; it must first be interpreted as a number for the subtraction operation.  If that conversion to a number fails, the expression will result in NaN.  This numeric result is then compared to the original value you passed in.  Since the left hand side is now numeric, type coercion is again used.  Now that the input from both sides was coerced to the same type from the same original value, you would think they should always be the same (always true). However, there's a special rule that says NaN is never equal to NaN, and so a value that can't be converted to a number (and only values that cannot be converted to numbers) will result in false. 
The check on the length is for a special case involving empty strings. Also note that it falls down on your 0x89f test, but that's because in many environments that's an okay way to define a number literal.  If you want to catch that specific scenario you could add an additional check.  Even better, if that's your reason for not using isNaN() then just wrap your own function around isNaN() that can also do the additional check.
In summary, if you want to know if a value can be converted to a number, actually try to convert it to a number.

I went back and did some research for why a whitespace string did not have the expected output, and I think I get it now: an empty string is coerced to 0 rather than NaN. Simply trimming the string before the length check will handle this case.
Running the unit tests against the new code and it only fails on the infinity and boolean literals, and the only time that should be a problem is if you're generating code (really, who would type in a literal and check if it's numeric? You should know), and that would be some strange code to generate.
But, again, the only reason ever to use this is if for some reason you have to avoid isNaN().

What is the benefit/downside to using a switch statement vs. an if/else in C#.  I can't imagine there being that big of a difference, other than maybe the look of your code.
Is there any reason why the resulting IL or associated runtime performance would be radically different?

","86,402",222,75,c# .net switch-statement ,https://stackoverflow.com/questions/395618/is-there-any-significant-difference-between-using-if-else-and-switch-case-in-c,20,"
SWITCH statement only produces same assembly as IFs in debug or compatibility mode. In release, it will be compiled into jump table (through MSIL 'switch' statement)- which is O(1).
C# (unlike many other languages) also allows to switch on string constants - and this works a bit differently. It's obviously not practical to build jump tables for strings of arbitrary lengths, so most often such switch will be compiled into stack of IFs. 
But if number of conditions is big enough to cover overheads, C# compiler will create a HashTable object, populate it with string constants and make a lookup on that table followed by jump. Hashtable lookup is not strictly O(1) and has noticeable constant costs, but if number of case labels is large, it will be significantly faster than comparing to each string constant in IFs.
To sum it up, if number of conditions is more than 5 or so, prefer SWITCH over IF, otherwise use whatever looks better.
",352,"
In general (considering all languages and all compilers) a switch statement CAN SOMETIMES be more efficient than an if / else statement, because it is easy for a compiler to generate jump tables from switch statements. It is possible to do the same thing for if / else statements, given appropriate constraints, but that is much more difficult.
In the case of C#, this is also true, but for other reasons.
With a large number of strings, there is a significant performance advantage to using a switch statement, because the compiler will use a hash table to implement the jump.
With a small number of strings, the performance between the two is the same.
This is because in that case the C# compiler does not generate a jump table. Instead it generates MSIL that is equivalent to IF / ELSE blocks.
There is a ""switch statement"" MSIL instruction that when jitted will use a jump table to implement a switch statement. It only works with integer types, however (this question asks about strings).
For small numbers of strings, it's more efficient for the compiler to generate IF / ELSE blocks then it is to use a hash table.
When I originally noticed this, I made the assumption that because IF / ELSE blocks were used with a small number of strings, that the compiler did the same transformation for large numbers of strings.
This was WRONG. 'IMA' was kind enough to point this out to me (well...he wasn't kind about it, but he was right, and I was wrong, which is the important part)
I also made a bone headed assumption about the lack of a ""switch"" instruction in MSIL (I figured, if there was a switch primitive, why weren't they using it with a hash table, so there must not be a switch primitive.... ). This was both wrong, and incredibly stupid on my part. Again 'IMA' pointed this out to me.
I made the updates here because it's the highest rated post, and the accepted answer.
However,I've made it Community Wiki because I figure I don't deserve the REP for being wrong. If you get a chance, please up vote 'ima''s post.

What are some real world places that call for delegates?  I'm curious what situations or patterns are present where this method is the best solution.  No code required.
","45,258",109,43,oop design-patterns delegates ,https://stackoverflow.com/questions/31497/where-do-i-use-delegates,8,"

A delegate is a named type that defines a particular kind of method. Just as a class definition lays out all the members for the given kind of object it defines, the delegate lays out the method signature for the kind of method it defines.

Based on this statement, a delegate is a function pointer and it defines what that function looks like.
A great example for a real world application of a delegate is the Predicate.  In the example from the link, you will notice that Array.Find takes the array to search and then a predicate to handle the criteria of what to find.  In this case it passes a method ProductGT10 which matches the Predicate signature.

As stated in ""Learning C# 3.0: Master the fundamentals of C# 3.0""

General Scenario:   When a head of state dies, the President of the United States typically does not have time to attend the funeral
personally. Instead, he dispatches a delegate. Often this delegate is
the Vice President, but sometimes the VP is unavailable and the
President must send someone else, such as the Secretary of State or
even the First Lady. He does not want to “hardwire” his delegated
authority to a single person; he might delegate this responsibility to
anyone who is able to execute the correct international protocol.
The President defines in advance what responsibility will be delegated
(attend the funeral), what parameters will be passed (condolences,
kind words), and what value he hopes to get back (good will). He then
assigns a particular person to that delegated responsibility at
“runtime” as the course of his presidency progresses.
In programming Scenario:   You are often faced with situations where you need to execute a particular action, but you don’t know in
advance which method, or even which object, you’ll want to call upon
to execute it.
For Example:   A button might not know which object or objects need to be notified. Rather than wiring the button to a particular
object, you will connect the button to a delegate and then resolve
that delegate to a particular method when the program executes.

Is there a plugin-less way of retrieving query string values via jQuery (or without)? 
If so, how? If not, is there a plugin which can do so?

Update: Sep-2018
You can use URLSearchParams which is simple and has decent (but not complete) browser support.
const urlParams = new URLSearchParams(window.location.search);
const myParam = urlParams.get('myParam');

PS
Unfortunately URLSearchParams don't properly parse query strings with string keyed values.
You might want to try locutus/parse_str
console.log(new URLSearchParams('a=b&c=d').toString()); // a=b&c=d
console.log(new URLSearchParams('a=b&c=d').get('a')); // b
console.log(new URLSearchParams('filters[a]=b&filters[c]=d').toString()); // filters%5Ba%5D=b&filters%5Bc%5D=d
console.log(new URLSearchParams('filters[a]=b&filters[c]=d').get('filters')); // null

Original
You don't need jQuery for that purpose. You can use just some pure JavaScript:
function getParameterByName(name, url = window.location.href) {
    name = name.replace(/[\[\]]/g, '\\$&');
    var regex = new RegExp('[?&]' + name + '(=([^&#]*)|&|#|$)'),
        results = regex.exec(url);
    if (!results) return null;
    if (!results[2]) return '';
    return decodeURIComponent(results[2].replace(/\+/g, ' '));
}

Usage:
// query string: ?foo=lorem&bar=&baz
var foo = getParameterByName('foo'); // ""lorem""
var bar = getParameterByName('bar'); // """" (present with empty value)
var baz = getParameterByName('baz'); // """" (present with no value)
var qux = getParameterByName('qux'); // null (absent)


Note: If a parameter is present several times (`?foo=lorem&foo=ipsum`), you will get the first value (`lorem`). There is no standard about this and usages vary, see for example this question: [Authoritative position of duplicate HTTP GET query keys](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/1746507/authoritative-position-of-duplicate-http-get-query-keys).  
NOTE: The function is case-sensitive. If you prefer case-insensitive parameter name, [add 'i' modifier to RegExp][2]

This is an update based on the new URLSearchParams specs to achieve the same result more succinctly. See answer titled ""URLSearchParams"" below.
",8588,"
Some of the solutions posted here are inefficient. Repeating the regular expression search every time the script needs to access a parameter is completely unnecessary, one single function to split up the parameters into an associative-array style object is enough. If you're not working with the HTML 5 History API, this is only necessary once per page load.  The other suggestions here also fail to decode the URL correctly.
var urlParams;
(window.onpopstate = function () {
    var match,
        pl     = /\+/g,  // Regex for replacing addition symbol with a space
        search = /([^&=]+)=?([^&]*)/g,
        decode = function (s) { return decodeURIComponent(s.replace(pl, "" "")); },
        query  = window.location.search.substring(1);

    urlParams = {};
    while (match = search.exec(query))
       urlParams[decode(match[1])] = decode(match[2]);
})();
Example querystring: 

?i=main&mode=front&sid=de8d49b78a85a322c4155015fdce22c4&enc=+Hello%20&empty

Result:
 urlParams = {
    enc: "" Hello "",
    i: ""main"",
    mode: ""front"",
    sid: ""de8d49b78a85a322c4155015fdce22c4"",
    empty: """"
}

alert(urlParams[""mode""]);
// -> ""front""

alert(""empty"" in urlParams);
// -> true

This could easily be improved upon to handle array-style query strings too.  An example of this is here, but since array-style parameters aren't defined in RFC 3986 I won't pollute this answer with the source code. For those interested in a ""polluted"" version, look at campbeln's answer below.
Also, as pointed out in the comments, ; is a legal delimiter for key=value pairs.  It would require a more complicated regex to handle ; or &, which I think is unnecessary because it's rare that ; is used and I would say even more unlikely that both would be used.  If you need to support ; instead of &, just swap them in the regex.
 
If you're using a server-side preprocessing language, you might want to use its native JSON functions to do the heavy lifting for you.  For example, in PHP you can write:
<script>var urlParams = <?php echo json_encode($_GET, JSON_HEX_TAG);?>;</script>
Much simpler!
UPDATED

A new capability would be to retrieve repeated params as following myparam=1&myparam=2. There is not a specification, however, most of the current approaches follow the generation of an array.

myparam = [""1"", ""2""]

So, this is the approach to manage it:
let urlParams = {};
(window.onpopstate = function () {
    let match,
        pl = /\+/g,  // Regex for replacing addition symbol with a space
        search = /([^&=]+)=?([^&]*)/g,
        decode = function (s) {
            return decodeURIComponent(s.replace(pl, "" ""));
        },
        query = window.location.search.substring(1);

    while (match = search.exec(query)) {
        if (decode(match[1]) in urlParams) {
            if (!Array.isArray(urlParams[decode(match[1])])) {
                urlParams[decode(match[1])] = [urlParams[decode(match[1])]];
            }
            urlParams[decode(match[1])].push(decode(match[2]));
        } else {
            urlParams[decode(match[1])] = decode(match[2]);
        }
    }

You don't quite have SQL Server's proprietary UPDATE FROM syntax down. Also not sure why you needed to join on the CommonField and also filter on it afterward.  Try this:
UPDATE t1
  SET t1.CalculatedColumn = t2.[Calculated Column]
  FROM dbo.Table1 AS t1
  INNER JOIN dbo.Table2 AS t2
  ON t1.CommonField = t2.[Common Field]
  WHERE t1.BatchNo = '110';

If you're doing something really silly - like constantly trying to set the value of one column to the aggregate of another column (which violates the principle of avoiding storing redundant data), you can use a CTE (common table expression) - see here and here for more details:
;WITH t2 AS
(
  SELECT [key], CalculatedColumn = SUM(some_column)

)
UPDATE t1
  SET t1.CalculatedColumn = t2.CalculatedColumn
  FROM dbo.table1 AS t1
  INNER JOIN t2
  ON t1.[key] = t2.[key];

The reason this is really silly, is that you're going to have to re-run this entire update every single time any row in table2 changes. A SUM is something you can always calculate at runtime and, in doing so, never have to worry that the result is stale.

Therefore, even though Querystring is secured it's not recommended to transfer sensitive data over querystring.

From a ""sniff the network packet"" point of view a GET request is safe, as the browser will first establish the secure connection and then send the request containing the GET parameters. But GET url's will be stored in the users browser history / autocomplete, which is not a good place to store e.g. password data in. Of course this only applies if you take the broader ""Webservice"" definition that might access the service from a browser, if you access it only from your custom application this should not be a problem.
So using post at least for password dialogs should be preferred. Also as pointed out in the link littlegeek posted a GET URL is more likely to be written to your server logs.

What is the main difference between an inner class and a static nested class in Java? Does design / implementation play a role in choosing one of these?
","752,154",1810,779,java inner-classes static-classes ,https://stackoverflow.com/questions/70324/java-inner-class-and-static-nested-class,27,"
From the Java Tutorial:

Nested classes are divided into two categories: static and non-static. Nested classes that are declared static are simply called static nested classes. Non-static nested classes are called inner classes. 

Static nested classes are accessed using the enclosing class name:
OuterClass.StaticNestedClass

For example, to create an object for the static nested class, use this syntax:
OuterClass.StaticNestedClass nestedObject = new OuterClass.StaticNestedClass();

Objects that are instances of an inner class exist within an instance of the outer class. Consider the following classes:
class OuterClass {
    ...
    class InnerClass {
        ...
    }
}

An instance of InnerClass can exist only within an instance of OuterClass and has direct access to the methods and fields of its enclosing instance.
To instantiate an inner class, you must first instantiate the outer class. Then, create the inner object within the outer object with this syntax:
OuterClass outerObject = new OuterClass()
OuterClass.InnerClass innerObject = outerObject.new InnerClass();

see: Java Tutorial - Nested Classes
For completeness note that there is also such a thing as an inner class without an enclosing instance:
class A {
  int t() { return 1; }
  static A a =  new A() { int t() { return 2; } };
}

Here, new A() { ... } is an inner class defined in a static context and does not have an enclosing instance.
",1729,"
The Java tutorial says:

Terminology: Nested classes are
  divided into two categories: static
  and non-static. Nested classes that
  are declared static are simply called
  static nested classes. Non-static
  nested classes are called inner
  classes.

In common parlance, the terms ""nested"" and ""inner"" are used interchangeably by most programmers, but I'll use the correct term ""nested class"" which covers both inner and static.
Classes can be nested ad infinitum, e.g. class A can contain class B which contains class C which contains class D, etc. However, more than one level of class nesting is rare, as it is generally bad design.
There are three reasons you might create a nested class:

organization: sometimes it seems most sensible to sort a class into the namespace of another class, especially when it won't be used in any other context
access: nested classes have special access to the variables/fields of their containing classes (precisely which variables/fields depends on the kind of nested class, whether inner or static).
convenience: having to create a new file for every new type is bothersome, again, especially when the type will only be used in one context

There are four kinds of nested class in Java. In brief, they are:

static class: declared as a static member of another class
inner class: declared as an instance member of another class
local inner class: declared inside an instance method of another class
anonymous inner class: like a local inner class, but written as an expression which returns a one-off object

Let me elaborate in more details.

Static Classes
Static classes are the easiest kind to understand because they have nothing to do with instances of the containing class.
A static class is a class declared as a static member of another class. Just like other static members, such a class is really just a hanger on that uses the containing class as its namespace, e.g. the class Goat declared as a static member of class Rhino in the package pizza is known by the name pizza.Rhino.Goat.
package pizza;

public class Rhino {

    ...

    public static class Goat {
        ...
    }
}

Frankly, static classes are a pretty worthless feature because classes are already divided into namespaces by packages. The only real conceivable reason to create a static class is that such a class has access to its containing class's private static members, but I find this to be a pretty lame justification for the static class feature to exist.

Inner Classes
An inner class is a class declared as a non-static member of another class:
package pizza;

public class Rhino {

    public class Goat {
        ...
    }

    private void jerry() {
        Goat g = new Goat();
    }
}

Like with a static class, the inner class is known as qualified by its containing class name, pizza.Rhino.Goat, but inside the containing class, it can be known by its simple name. However, every instance of an inner class is tied to a particular instance of its containing class: above, the Goat created in jerry, is implicitly tied to the Rhino instance this in jerry. Otherwise, we make the associated Rhino instance explicit when we instantiate Goat:
Rhino rhino = new Rhino();
Rhino.Goat goat = rhino.new Goat();

(Notice you refer to the inner type as just Goat in the weird new syntax: Java infers the containing type from the rhino part. And, yes new rhino.Goat() would have made more sense to me too.)
So what does this gain us? Well, the inner class instance has access to the instance members of the containing class instance. These enclosing instance members are referred to inside the inner class via just their simple names, not via this (this in the inner class refers to the inner class instance, not the associated containing class instance): 
public class Rhino {

    private String barry;

    public class Goat {
        public void colin() {
            System.out.println(barry);
        }
    }
}

In the inner class, you can refer to this of the containing class as Rhino.this, and you can use this to refer to its members, e.g. Rhino.this.barry.

Local Inner Classes
A local inner class is a class declared in the body of a method. Such a class is only known within its containing method, so it can only be instantiated and have its members accessed within its containing method. The gain is that a local inner class instance is tied to and can access the final local variables of its containing method. When the instance uses a final local of its containing method, the variable retains the value it held at the time of the instance's creation, even if the variable has gone out of scope (this is effectively Java's crude, limited version of closures).
Because a local inner class is neither the member of a class or package, it is not declared with an access level. (Be clear, however, that its own members have access levels like in a normal class.)
If a local inner class is declared in an instance method, an instantiation of the inner class is tied to the instance held by the containing method's this at the time of the instance's creation, and so the containing class's instance members are accessible like in an instance inner class. A local inner class is instantiated simply via its name, e.g. local inner class Cat is instantiated as new Cat(), not new this.Cat() as you might expect.

Anonymous Inner Classes
An anonymous inner class is a syntactically convenient way of writing a local inner class. Most commonly, a local inner class is instantiated at most just once each time its containing method is run. It would be nice, then, if we could combine the local inner class definition and its single instantiation into one convenient syntax form, and it would also be nice if we didn't have to think up a name for the class (the fewer unhelpful names your code contains, the better). An anonymous inner class allows both these things:
new *ParentClassName*(*constructorArgs*) {*members*}

This is an expression returning a new instance of an unnamed class which extends ParentClassName. You cannot supply your own constructor; rather, one is implicitly supplied which simply calls the super constructor, so the arguments supplied must fit the super constructor. (If the parent contains multiple constructors, the “simplest” one is called, “simplest” as determined by a rather complex set of rules not worth bothering to learn in detail--just pay attention to what NetBeans or Eclipse tell you.)
Alternatively, you can specify an interface to implement:
new *InterfaceName*() {*members*}

Such a declaration creates a new instance of an unnamed class which extends Object and implements InterfaceName. Again, you cannot supply your own constructor; in this case, Java implicitly supplies a no-arg, do-nothing constructor (so there will never be constructor arguments in this case).
Even though you can't give an anonymous inner class a constructor, you can still do any setup you want using an initializer block (a {} block placed outside any method).
Be clear that an anonymous inner class is simply a less flexible way of creating a local inner class with one instance. If you want a local inner class which implements multiple interfaces or which implements interfaces while extending some class other than Object or which specifies its own constructor, you're stuck creating a regular named local inner class.

What about isEmpty() ?
if(str != null && !str.isEmpty())

Be sure to use the parts of && in this order, because java will not proceed to evaluate the second part if the first part of && fails, thus ensuring you will not get a null pointer exception from str.isEmpty() if str is null.
Beware, it's only available since Java SE 1.6. You have to check str.length() == 0 on previous versions.

To ignore whitespace as well:
if(str != null && !str.trim().isEmpty())

(since Java 11 str.trim().isEmpty() can be reduced to str.isBlank() which will also test for other Unicode white spaces)
Wrapped in a handy function:
public static boolean empty( final String s ) {
  // Null-safe, short-circuit evaluation.
  return s == null || s.trim().isEmpty();
}

Becomes:
if( !empty( str ) )

Git keeps all of its files in the .git directory. Just remove that one and init again.
If you can't find it, it's because it is hidden.

In Windows 7, you need to go to your folder, click on Organize on the top left, then click on Folder and search options, then click on the View tab and click on the Show hidden files, folders and drives radio button.
On a Mac OS:

Open a Terminal (via Spotlight: press CMD + SPACE, type terminal and press Enter) and run:
defaults write com.apple.finder AppleShowAllFiles 1 && killall Finder

Note: The keyboard shortcut to show hidden files in Finder is 
CMD + SHIFT + . so it is no longer necessary to modify the 
finder config this way
You could also type cd (the space is important), drag and drop your git repo folder from Finder to the terminal window, press return, then type rm -fr .git, then return again.

On Ubuntu, use shortcut Ctrl + H.

The key is whether you are writing a single concatenation all in one place or accumulating it over time.
For the example you gave, there's no point in explicitly using StringBuilder. (Look at the compiled code for your first case.)

To clarify, assuming that hugeArray contains thousands of strings, code like this:

When I set up a table view with 4 rows, there are still extra separators lines (or extra blank cells) below the filled rows.
How would I remove these cells?

Interface builder (iOS 9+)
Just drag a UIView to the table.  In storyboard, it will sit at the top below your custom cells.  You may prefer to name it ""footer"".
Here it is shown in green for clarity, you'd probably want clear color.
Note that by adjusting the height, you can affect how the ""bottom bounce"" of the table is handled, as you prefer. (Height zero is usually fine).


To do it programmatically: 
Swift
override func viewDidLoad() {
    super.viewDidLoad()
    self.tableView.tableFooterView = UIView()
}

Objective-C
iOS 6.1+
- (void)viewDidLoad 
{
    [super viewDidLoad];

    // This will remove extra separators from tableview
    self.tableView.tableFooterView = [UIView new];
}

or if you prefer,
    self.tableView.tableFooterView = [[UIView alloc] initWithFrame:CGRectZero];

Historically in iOS:
Add to the table view controller...
- (CGFloat)tableView:(UITableView *)tableView heightForFooterInSection:(NSInteger)section {
     // This will create a ""invisible"" footer
     return CGFLOAT_MIN;
 }

and if necessary...
- (UIView *)tableView:(UITableView *)tableView viewForFooterInSection:(NSInteger)section
{        
    return [UIView new];

    // If you are not using ARC:
    // return [[UIView new] autorelease];
}

",1532,"
Here's another way to do that w/out the grouped table style, and one you'd probably not guess. Adding a header and footer to the table (perhaps one or the other suffices, haven't checked) causes the separators to disappear from the filler/blank rows.
I stumbled onto this because I wanted a little space at the top and bottom of tables to decrease the risk of hitting buttons instead of a table cell with meaty fingers. Here's a method to stick a blank view in as header and footer. Use whatever height you like, you still eliminate the extra separator lines.
- (void) addHeaderAndFooter
{
    UIView *v = [[UIView alloc] initWithFrame:CGRectMake(0, 0, 320, 10)];
    v.backgroundColor = [UIColor clearColor];
    [self.myTableView setTableHeaderView:v];
    [self.myTableView setTableFooterView:v];
    [v release];
}


In response to @Casebash, I went back to the code in my app (""AcmeLists"" List Manager in iTunes store...) and short-circuited the addHeaderAndFooter method to verify. Without it, I have the extra row separators; with the code, I have what you see in this window snap: no table row separators picture. So I'm not sure why it wouldn't have worked for you. Moreover, it makes sense to me that having any custom footer on a table view would necessarily have to stop drawing row separators for blank rows below it. That would be hideous. For reference, I looked at tables where there were more rows than could be viewed on screen, and then for a table with two rows. In both cases, no extraneous separators.
Perhaps your custom views were not actually added. To check that, set the background color to something other than clearColor, e.g., [UIColor redColor]. If you don't see some red bars at the bottom of the table, your footer wasn't set.

A common problem that new Java developers experience is that their programs fail to run with the error message:  Could not find or load main class ...
What does this mean, what causes it, and how should you fix it?
","2,887,282",1457,508,java class main ,https://stackoverflow.com/questions/18093928/what-does-could-not-find-or-load-main-class-mean,50,"
The java <class-name> command syntax
First of all, you need to understand the correct way to launch a program using the java (or javaw) command.
The normal syntax1 is this:
    java [ <options> ] <class-name> [<arg> ...]

where <option> is a command line option (starting with a ""-"" character), <class-name> is a fully qualified Java class name, and <arg> is an arbitrary command line argument that gets passed to your application.  

1 - There are some other syntaxes which are described near the end of this answer.
The fully qualified name (FQN) for the class is conventionally written as you would in Java source code; e.g.
    packagename.packagename2.packagename3.ClassName

However some versions of the java command allow you to use slashes instead of periods; e.g.
    packagename/packagename2/packagename3/ClassName

which (confusingly) looks like a file pathname, but isn't one.  Note that the term fully qualified name is standard Java terminology ... not something I just made up to confuse you :-)
Here is an example of what a java command should look like:
    java -Xmx100m com.acme.example.ListUsers fred joe bert

The above is going to cause the java command to do the following:

Search for the compiled version of the com.acme.example.ListUsers class.
Load the class.
Check that the class has a main method with signature, return type and modifiers given by public static void main(String[]).  (Note, the method argument's name is NOT part of the signature.)
Call that method passing it the command line arguments (""fred"", ""joe"", ""bert"") as a String[].

Reasons why Java cannot find the class
When you get the message ""Could not find or load main class ..."", that means that the first step has failed.  The java command was not able to find the class.  And indeed, the ""..."" in the message will be the fully qualified class name that java is looking for. 
So why might it be unable to find the class?  
Reason #1 - you made a mistake with the classname argument
The first likely cause is that you may have provided the wrong class name.  (Or ... the right class name, but in the wrong form.)   Considering the example above, here are a variety of wrong ways to specify the class name:

Example #1 - a simple class name:
java ListUser

When the class is declared in a package such as com.acme.example, then you must use the full classname including the package name in the java command; e.g. 
java com.acme.example.ListUser

Example #2 - a filename or pathname rather than a class name:
java ListUser.class
java com/acme/example/ListUser.class

Example #3 - a class name with the casing incorrect:
java com.acme.example.listuser

Example #4 - a typo
java com.acme.example.mistuser

Example #5 - a source filename (except for Java 11 or later; see below)
java ListUser.java

Example #6 - you forgot the class name entirely
java lots of arguments


Reason #2 - the application's classpath is incorrectly specified
The second likely cause is that the class name is correct, but that the java command cannot find the class.  To understand this, you need to understand the concept of the ""classpath"".  This is explained well by the Oracle documentation:

The java command documentation
Setting the Classpath. 
The Java Tutorial - PATH and CLASSPATH

So ... if you have specified the class name correctly, the next thing to check is that you have specified the classpath correctly:

Read the three documents linked above.  (Yes ... READ them!  It is important that a Java programmer understands at least the basics of how the Java classpath mechanisms works.)
Look at command line and / or the CLASSPATH environment variable that is in effect when you run the java command.  Check that the directory names and JAR file names are correct.
If there are relative pathnames in the classpath, check that they resolve correctly ... from the current directory that is in effect when you run the java command.
Check that the class (mentioned in the error message) can be located on the effective classpath.
Note that the classpath syntax is different for Windows versus Linux and Mac OS. (The classpath separator is ; on Windows and : on the others.  If you use the wrong separator for your platform, you won't get an explicit error message.  Instead, you will get a nonexistent file or directory on the path that will be silently ignored.)

Reason #2a - the wrong directory is on the classpath
When you put a directory on the classpath, it notionally corresponds to the root of the qualified name space.  Classes are located in the directory structure beneath that root, by mapping the fully qualified name to a pathname.  So for example, if ""/usr/local/acme/classes"" is on the class path, then when the JVM looks for a class called com.acme.example.Foon, it will look for a "".class"" file with this pathname:
  /usr/local/acme/classes/com/acme/example/Foon.class

If you had put ""/usr/local/acme/classes/com/acme/example"" on the classpath, then the JVM wouldn't be able to find the class.
Reason #2b - the subdirectory path doesn't match the FQN
If your classes FQN is com.acme.example.Foon, then the JVM is going to look for ""Foon.class"" in the directory ""com/acme/example"":

If your directory structure doesn't match the package naming as per the pattern above, the JVM won't find your class.
If you attempt rename a class by moving it, that will fail as well ... but the exception stacktrace will be different.  It is liable to say something like this:
Caused by: java.lang.NoClassDefFoundError: <path> (wrong name: <name>)

because the FQN in the class file doesn't match what the class loader is expecting to find.

To give a concrete example, supposing that:

you want to run com.acme.example.Foon class,
the full file path is /usr/local/acme/classes/com/acme/example/Foon.class,
your current working directory is /usr/local/acme/classes/com/acme/example/,

then:
# wrong, FQN is needed
java Foon

# wrong, there is no `com/acme/example` folder in the current working directory
java com.acme.example.Foon

# wrong, similar to above
java -classpath . com.acme.example.Foon

# fine; relative classpath set
java -classpath ../../.. com.acme.example.Foon

# fine; absolute classpath set
java -classpath /usr/local/acme/classes com.acme.example.Foon

Notes:

The -classpath option can be shortened to -cp in most Java releases.  Check the respective manual entries for java, javac and so on.
Think carefully when choosing between absolute and relative pathnames in classpaths.  Remember that a relative pathname may ""break"" if the current directory changes.  

Reason #2c - dependencies missing from the classpath
The classpath needs to include all of the other (non-system) classes that your application depends on.  (The system classes are located automatically, and you rarely need to concern yourself with this.)  For the main class to load correctly, the JVM needs to find:

the class itself.
all classes and interfaces in the superclass hierarchy (e.g. see Java class is present in classpath but startup fails with Error: Could not find or load main class)
all classes and interfaces that are referred to by means of variable or variable declarations, or method call or field access expressions.

(Note: the JLS and JVM specifications allow some scope for a JVM to load classes ""lazily"", and this can affect when a classloader exception is thrown.)
Reason #3 - the class has been declared in the wrong package
It occasionally happens that someone puts a source code file into the
the wrong folder in their source code tree, or they leave out the package declaration.  If you do this in an IDE, the IDE's compiler will tell you about this immediately.  Similarly if you use a decent Java build tool, the tool will run javac in a way that will detect the problem.  However, if you build your Java code by hand, you can do it in such a way that the compiler doesn't notice the problem, and the resulting "".class"" file is not in the place that you expect it to be.
Still can't find the problem?
There lots of things to check, and it is easy to miss something.  Try adding the -Xdiag option to the java command line (as the first thing after java).  It will output various things about class loading, and this may offer you clues as to what the real problem is.
Also, consider possible problems caused by copying and pasting invisible or non-ASCII characters from websites, documents and so on.  And consider ""homoglyphs"", were two letters or symbols look the same ... but aren't.
Finally, you can apparently run into this problem if you try to launch from a JAR file with incorrect signatures in (META-INF/*.SF).

Alternative syntaxes for java
There are three alternative syntaxes for the launching Java programs using the java command.
1) The syntax used for launching an ""executable"" JAR file is as follows:
  java [ <options> ] -jar <jar-file-name> [<arg> ...]

e.g.
  java -Xmx100m -jar /usr/local/acme-example/listuser.jar fred

The name of the entry-point class (i.e. com.acme.example.ListUser) and the classpath are specified in the MANIFEST of the JAR file.
2) The syntax for launching an application from a module (Java 9 and later) is as follows:
  java [ <options> ] --module <module>[/<mainclass>] [<arg> ...]

The name of the entrypoint class is either defined by the <module> itself, or is given by the optional <mainclass>.
3) From Java 11 onwards, you can compile and run a single source code file  and run it with the following syntax:
  java [ <options> ] <sourcefile> [<arg> ...]

where  is (typically) a file with the suffix "".java"".
For more details, please refer to the official documentation for the java command for the Java release that you are using.

IDEs
A typical Java IDE has support for running Java applications in the IDE JVM itself or in a child JVM.  These are generally immune from this particular exception, because the IDE uses its own mechanisms to construct the runtime classpath, identify the main class and create the java command line.
However it is still possible for this exception to occur, if you do things behind the back of the IDE.  For example, if you have previously set up an Application Launcher for your Java app in Eclipse, and you then moved the JAR file containing the ""main"" class to a different place in the file system without telling Eclipse, Eclipse would unwittingly launch the JVM with an incorrect classpath.
In short, if you get this problem in an IDE, check for things like stale IDE state, broken project references or broken launcher configurations.
It is also possible for an IDE to simply get confused.  IDE's are hugely complicated pieces of software comprising many interacting parts.  Many of these parts adopt various caching strategies in order to make the IDE as a whole responsive.  These can sometimes go wrong, and one possible symptom is problems when launching applications.  If you suspect this could be happening, it is worth trying other things like restarting your IDE, rebuilding the project and so on.

We all know you can't do the following because of ConcurrentModificationException:
for (Object i : l) {
    if (condition(i)) {
        l.remove(i);
    }
}

But this apparently works sometimes, but not always. Here's some specific code:
public static void main(String[] args) {
    Collection<Integer> l = new ArrayList<>();

    for (int i = 0; i < 10; ++i) {
        l.add(4);
        l.add(5);

        }
    }

    System.out.println(l);
}

This, of course, results in:
Exception in thread ""main"" java.util.ConcurrentModificationException

Even though multiple threads aren't doing it. Anyway.
What's the best solution to this problem? How can I remove an item from the collection in a loop without throwing this exception?
I'm also using an arbitrary Collection here, not necessarily an ArrayList, so you can't rely on get.

Iterator.remove() is safe, you can use it like this:
List<String> list = new ArrayList<>();

// This is a clever way to create the iterator and call iterator.hasNext() like
// you would do in a while-loop. It would be the same as doing:
//     Iterator<String> iterator = list.iterator();
//     while (iterator.hasNext()) {
for (Iterator<String> iterator = list.iterator(); iterator.hasNext();) {
    String string = iterator.next();
    if (string.isEmpty()) {
        // Remove the current element from the iterator and the list.
        iterator.remove();
    }
}

Note that Iterator.remove() is the only safe way to modify a collection during iteration; the behavior is unspecified if the underlying collection is modified in any other way while the iteration is in progress.
Source: docs.oracle > The Collection Interface

And similarly, if you have a ListIterator and want to add items, you can use ListIterator#add, for the same reason you can use Iterator#remove — it's designed to allow it.

In your case you tried to remove from a list, but the same restriction applies if trying to put into a Map while iterating its content.

This works:
Iterator<Integer> iter = l.iterator();
while (iter.hasNext()) {
    if (iter.next() == 5) {

I assumed that since a foreach loop is syntactic sugar for iterating, using an iterator wouldn't help... but it gives you this .remove() functionality.

If you're in the global scope then there's not much difference. Read Kangax's answer for explanation
If you're in a function then var will create a local variable, ""no var"" will look up the scope chain until it finds the variable or hits the global scope (at which point it will create it):
// These are both globals
var foo = 1;
bar = 2;

function()
{
    var foo = 1; // Local
    bar = 2;     // Global

    // Execute an anonymous function
    (function()
    {
        var wibble = 1; // Local
        foo = 2; // Inherits from scope above (creating a closure)
        moo = 3; // Global
    }())
}

If you're not doing an assignment then you need to use var:
var x; // Declare x

",1374,"
There's a difference.
var x = 1 declares variable x in current scope (aka execution context). If the declaration appears in a function - a local variable is declared; if it's in global scope - a global variable is declared.
x = 1, on the other hand, is merely a property assignment. It first tries to resolve x against scope chain. If it finds it anywhere in that scope chain, it performs assignment; if it doesn't find x, only then does it creates x property on a global object (which is a top level object in a scope chain). 
Now, notice that it doesn't declare a global variable, it creates a global property.
The difference between the two is subtle and might be confusing unless you understand that variable declarations also create properties (only on a Variable Object) and that every property in Javascript (well, ECMAScript) have certain flags that describe their properties - ReadOnly, DontEnum and DontDelete.
Since variable declaration creates property with the DontDelete flag, the difference between var x = 1 and x = 1 (when executed in global scope) is that the former one - variable declaration - creates the DontDelete'able property, and latter one doesn't. As a consequence, the property created via this implicit assignment can then be deleted from the global object, and the former one - the one created via variable declaration - cannot be deleted.
But this is just theory of course, and in practice there are even more differences between the two, due to various bugs in implementations (such as those from IE).
Hope it all makes sense : )

[Update 2010/12/16]
In ES5 (ECMAScript 5; recently standardized, 5th edition of the language) there's a so-called ""strict mode"" — an opt-in language mode, which slightly changes the behavior of undeclared assignments. In strict mode, assignment to an undeclared identifier is a ReferenceError. The rationale for this was to catch accidental assignments, preventing creation of undesired global properties. Some of the newer browsers have already started rolling support for strict mode. See, for example, my compat table.

I wrote the wrong thing in a commit message.
How can I change the message? The commit has not been pushed yet.
","2,679,298",7660,3290,git git-commit git-rewrite-history amend ,https://stackoverflow.com/questions/179123/how-to-modify-existing-unpushed-commit-messages,27,"
Amending the most recent commit message
git commit --amend

will open your editor, allowing you to change the commit message of the most recent commit. Additionally, you can set the commit message directly in the command line with:
git commit --amend -m ""New commit message""

…however, this can make multi-line commit messages or small corrections more cumbersome to enter.
Make sure you don't have any working copy changes staged before doing this or they will get committed too. (Unstaged changes will not get committed.)
Changing the message of a commit that you've already pushed to your remote branch
If you've already pushed your commit up to your remote branch, then - after amending your commit locally (as described above) - you'll also need to force push the commit with:
git push <remote> <branch> --force
# Or
git push <remote> <branch> -f

Warning: force-pushing will overwrite the remote branch with the state of your local one. If there are commits on the remote branch that you don't have in your local branch, you will lose those commits.
Warning: be cautious about amending commits that you have already shared with other people. Amending commits essentially rewrites them to have different SHA IDs, which poses a problem if other people have copies of the old commit that you've rewritten. Anyone who has a copy of the old commit will need to synchronize their work with your newly re-written commit, which can sometimes be difficult, so make sure you coordinate with others when attempting to rewrite shared commit history, or just avoid rewriting shared commits altogether.

Perform an interactive rebase
Another option is to use interactive rebase.
This allows you to edit any message you want to update even if it's not the latest message.
In order to do a Git squash, follow these steps:
// n is the number of commits up to the last commit you want to be able to edit
git rebase -i HEAD~n

Once you squash your commits - choose the e/r for editing the message:

Important note about interactive rebase
When you use git rebase -i HEAD~n there can be more than n commits. Git will ""collect"" all the commits in the last n commits, and if there was a merge somewhere in between that range you will see all the commits as well, so the outcome will be n + .
Good tip:
If you have to do it for more than a single branch and you might face conflicts when amending the content, set up git rerere and let Git resolve those conflicts automatically for you.

Is there a plugin-less way of retrieving query string values via jQuery (or without)? 
If so, how? If not, is there a plugin which can do so?
","3,946,668",2696,2048,javascript url plugins query-string ,https://stackoverflow.com/questions/901115/how-can-i-get-query-string-values-in-javascript,73,"
Update: Sep-2018
You can use URLSearchParams which is simple and has decent (but not complete) browser support.
const urlParams = new URLSearchParams(window.location.search);
const myParam = urlParams.get('myParam');

PS
Unfortunately URLSearchParams don't properly parse query strings with string keyed values.
You might want to try locutus/parse_str
console.log(new URLSearchParams('a=b&c=d').toString()); // a=b&c=d
console.log(new URLSearchParams('a=b&c=d').get('a')); // b
console.log(new URLSearchParams('filters[a]=b&filters[c]=d').toString()); // filters%5Ba%5D=b&filters%5Bc%5D=d
console.log(new URLSearchParams('filters[a]=b&filters[c]=d').get('filters')); // null

Original
You don't need jQuery for that purpose. You can use just some pure JavaScript:
function getParameterByName(name, url = window.location.href) {
    name = name.replace(/[\[\]]/g, '\\$&');
    var regex = new RegExp('[?&]' + name + '(=([^&#]*)|&|#|$)'),
        results = regex.exec(url);
    if (!results) return null;
    if (!results[2]) return '';
    return decodeURIComponent(results[2].replace(/\+/g, ' '));
}

Usage:
// query string: ?foo=lorem&bar=&baz
var foo = getParameterByName('foo'); // ""lorem""
var bar = getParameterByName('bar'); // """" (present with empty value)
var baz = getParameterByName('baz'); // """" (present with no value)
var qux = getParameterByName('qux'); // null (absent)


Note: If a parameter is present several times (`?foo=lorem&foo=ipsum`), you will get the first value (`lorem`). There is no standard about this and usages vary, see for example this question: [Authoritative position of duplicate HTTP GET query keys](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/1746507/authoritative-position-of-duplicate-http-get-query-keys).  
NOTE: The function is case-sensitive. If you prefer case-insensitive parameter name, [add 'i' modifier to RegExp][2]

This is an update based on the new URLSearchParams specs to achieve the same result more succinctly. See answer titled ""URLSearchParams"" below.
",8588,"
Some of the solutions posted here are inefficient. Repeating the regular expression search every time the script needs to access a parameter is completely unnecessary, one single function to split up the parameters into an associative-array style object is enough. If you're not working with the HTML 5 History API, this is only necessary once per page load.  The other suggestions here also fail to decode the URL correctly.
var urlParams;
(window.onpopstate = function () {
    var match,
        pl     = /\+/g,  // Regex for replacing addition symbol with a space
        search = /([^&=]+)=?([^&]*)/g,
        decode = function (s) { return decodeURIComponent(s.replace(pl, "" "")); },
        query  = window.location.search.substring(1);

    urlParams = {};
    while (match = search.exec(query))
       urlParams[decode(match[1])] = decode(match[2]);
})();
Example querystring: 

?i=main&mode=front&sid=de8d49b78a85a322c4155015fdce22c4&enc=+Hello%20&empty

Result:
 urlParams = {
    enc: "" Hello "",
    i: ""main"",
    mode: ""front"",
    sid: ""de8d49b78a85a322c4155015fdce22c4"",
    empty: """"
}

alert(urlParams[""mode""]);
// -> ""front""

alert(""empty"" in urlParams);
// -> true

This could easily be improved upon to handle array-style query strings too.  An example of this is here, but since array-style parameters aren't defined in RFC 3986 I won't pollute this answer with the source code. For those interested in a ""polluted"" version, look at campbeln's answer below.
Also, as pointed out in the comments, ; is a legal delimiter for key=value pairs.  It would require a more complicated regex to handle ; or &, which I think is unnecessary because it's rare that ; is used and I would say even more unlikely that both would be used.  If you need to support ; instead of &, just swap them in the regex.
 
If you're using a server-side preprocessing language, you might want to use its native JSON functions to do the heavy lifting for you.  For example, in PHP you can write:
<script>var urlParams = <?php echo json_encode($_GET, JSON_HEX_TAG);?>;</script>
Much simpler!
UPDATED

A new capability would be to retrieve repeated params as following myparam=1&myparam=2. There is not a specification, however, most of the current approaches follow the generation of an array.

myparam = [""1"", ""2""]

So, this is the approach to manage it:
let urlParams = {};
(window.onpopstate = function () {
    let match,
        pl = /\+/g,  // Regex for replacing addition symbol with a space
        search = /([^&=]+)=?([^&]*)/g,
        decode = function (s) {
            return decodeURIComponent(s.replace(pl, "" ""));
        },
        query = window.location.search.substring(1);

    while (match = search.exec(query)) {
        if (decode(match[1]) in urlParams) {
            if (!Array.isArray(urlParams[decode(match[1])])) {
                urlParams[decode(match[1])] = [urlParams[decode(match[1])]];
            }
            urlParams[decode(match[1])].push(decode(match[2]));
        } else {
            urlParams[decode(match[1])] = decode(match[2]);
        }
    }
})();

{ thetop : 10 } is a valid object literal.  The code will create an object with a property named thetop that has a value of 10.  Both the following are the same:

In ES5 and earlier, you cannot use a variable as a property name inside an object literal.  Your only option is to do the following:
var thetop = ""top"";

aniArgs[thetop] = 10; 

// Pass the resulting object to the animate method

A task is something you want done.
A thread is one of the many possible workers which performs that task.
In .NET 4.0 terms, a Task represents an asynchronous operation. Thread(s) are used to complete that operation by breaking the work up into chunks and assigning to separate threads.
",318,"
In computer science terms, a Task is a future or a promise. (Some people use those two terms synomymously, some use them differently, nobody can agree on a precise definition.) Basically, a Task<T> ""promises"" to return you a T, but not right now honey, I'm kinda busy, why don't you come back later?
A Thread is a way of fulfilling that promise. But not every Task needs a brand-new Thread. (In fact, creating a thread is often undesirable, because doing so is much more expensive than re-using an existing thread from the threadpool. More on that in a moment.) If the value you are waiting for comes from the filesystem or a database or the network, then there is no need for a thread to sit around and wait for the data when it can be servicing other requests. Instead, the Task might register a callback to receive the value(s) when they're ready.
In particular, the Task does not say why it is that it takes such a long time to return the value. It might be that it takes a long time to compute, or it might that it takes a long time to fetch. Only in the former case would you use a Thread to run a Task. (In .NET, threads are freaking expensive, so you generally want to avoid them as much as possible and really only use them if you want to run multiple heavy computations on multiple CPUs. For example, in Windows, a thread weighs 12 KiByte (I think), in Linux, a thread weighs as little as 4 KiByte, in Erlang/BEAM even just 400 Byte. In .NET, it's 1 MiByte!)

User Pumbaa80's answer is great if you have an object you want pretty printed. If you're starting from a valid JSON string that you want to pretty printed, you need to convert it to an object first:
var jsonString = '{""some"":""json""}';
var jsonPretty = JSON.stringify(JSON.parse(jsonString),null,2);  

This builds a JSON object from the string, and then converts it back to a string using JSON stringify's pretty print.

I have a List with numbers, I'd like to find the position of the minimum (not value) using LINQ

",79,"
As you specifically asked for a LINQ solution, and all you got was non-LINQ solutions, here's a LINQ solution:
List<int> values = new List<int> { 3, 1, 0, 5 };

int index =
   values
   .Select((n, i) => new { Value = n, Index = i })
   .OrderBy(n=>n.Value)
   .First()
   .Index;

That however doesn't mean that LINQ is the best solution for this problem...
Edit:
With a bit more complex code this performs a little better:
int index =
   values
   .Select((n, i) => new { Value = n, Index = i })
   .Aggregate((a,b) => a.Value < b.Value ? a : b)
   .Index;

To get the best performance, you would use a plain loop go get through the items, while you keep track of the lowest:
int index = 0, value = values[0];
for (int i = 1; i < values.Length; i++) {
  if (values[i] < value) {
    value = values[i];
    index = i;
  }

The best solution I found so far is:

This is wrong because it doesn't work if the file name contains multiple . characters. If, let's say, I have a.b.js, it will consider a and b.js, instead of a.b and js.

file, ext = os.path.splitext(path)

Alternatively, you can focus on the last '/' of the path instead of the '.' which should work even if you have unpredictable file extensions:

As of Genymotion 2.10.0 and onwards, GApps can be installed from the emulator toolbar.
Please refer to answer by @MichaelStoddart.
Next follows former answer kept here for historic reason:
Genymotion doesn't provide Google Apps. To install Google Apps:

Upgrade Genymotion and VirtualBox to the latest version.
Download two zip files:
 - ARM Translation Installer v1.1
 - Google Apps for your Android version: 2.3.7 - 4.4.4 or 4.4 - 6.0 (with platform and variant) You can also find the GApps list in the wbroek user GitHubGist page.
Open Genymotion emulator and go to home screen then drag and drop the first file Genymotion-ARM-Translation_v1.1.zip over the emulator. A dialog will appear and show as file transfer in progress, then another dialog will appear and ask that do you want to flash it on the emulator. Click OK and reboot the device by running adb reboot from your terminal or command prompt. 
Drag and drop the second file gapps-*-signed.zip and repeat the same steps as above. Run adb reboot again and, once rebooted, Google Apps will be in the emulator. 
At this point 'Google Apps Services' will crash frequently with the following message google play services has stopped working. Open Google Play. After providing your account details, open Google Play and update your installed Google Apps. This seems to make Google Play realize you have an old Google Play Services and will ask you to update (in my case, updating Google Hangouts required a new version of Google Play Services). I've also heard that simply waiting will also prompt you to update. The 'Google Play Services' app doesn't seem to appear otherwise - you can't search for it. You should then see an offer to update Google Play Services. Once the new Google Play Services is installed you will now have stable, working access to Google Play

The latest version of Genymotion (2.10.0 onwards) now allows you to install GApps from the emulator toolbar:

355,2814805,541912,Interface naming in Java [closed],"



Most OO languages prefix their interface names with a capital I, why does Java not do this?  What was the rationale for not following this convention?
To demonstrate what I mean, if I wanted to have a User interface and a User implementation I'd have two choices in Java:

Where in most languages:

Class = User, Interface = IUser

Now, you might argue that you could always pick a most descriptive name for the user implementation and the problem goes away, but Java's pushing a POJO approach to things and   most IOC containers use DynamicProxies extensively.  These two things together mean that you'll have lots of interfaces with a single POJO implementation.
So, I guess my question boils down to: ""Is it worth following the broader Interface naming convention especially in light of where Java Frameworks seem to be heading?""
","204,615",326,104,java interface naming-conventions ,https://stackoverflow.com/questions/541912/interface-naming-in-java,11,"
I prefer not to use a prefix on interfaces:

The prefix hurts readability.
Using interfaces in clients is the standard best way to program, so interfaces names should be as short and pleasant as possible. Implementing classes should be uglier to discourage their use.
When changing from an abstract class to an interface a coding convention with prefix I implies renaming all the occurrences of the class --- not good!

",333,"
Is there really a difference between:
class User implements IUser

and
class UserImpl implements User

if all we're talking about is naming conventions?
Personally I prefer NOT preceding the interface with I as I want to be coding to the interface and I consider that to be more important in terms of the naming convention. If you call the interface IUser then every consumer of that class needs to know its an IUser. If you call the class UserImpl then only the class and your DI container know about the Impl part and the consumers just know they're working with a User.
Then again, the times I've been forced to use Impl because a better name doesn't present itself have been few and far between because the implementation gets named according to the implementation because that's where it's important, e.g.
class DbBasedAccountDAO implements AccountDAO
class InMemoryAccountDAO implements AccountDAO

For anyone interested in reading more about it, Stack Overflow user kangax has written an incredibly in-depth blog post about the delete statement on their blog, Understanding delete. It is highly recommended.
",8520,"
Objects in JavaScript can be thought of as maps between keys and values. The delete operator is used to remove these keys, more commonly known as object properties, one at a time.


var obj = {
  myProperty: 1    
}
console.log(obj.hasOwnProperty('myProperty')) // true
delete obj.myProperty
console.log(obj.hasOwnProperty('myProperty')) // false



The delete operator does not directly free memory, and it differs from simply assigning the value of null or undefined to a property, in that the property itself is removed from the object. Note that if the value of a deleted property was a reference type (an object), and another part of your program still holds a reference to that object, then that object will, of course, not be garbage collected until all references to it have disappeared.
delete will only work on properties whose descriptor marks them as configurable.

I believe that currently (5/1/2012), all major browsers support the outerHTML function.  It seems to me that this snippet is sufficient.  I personally would choose to memorize this:
// Gives you the DOM element without the outside wrapper you want
$('.classSelector').html()

// Gives you the outside wrapper as well only for the first element
$('.classSelector')[0].outerHTML

// Gives you the outer HTML for all the selected elements
var html = '';
$('.classSelector').each(function () {
    html += this.outerHTML;
});

//Or if you need a one liner for the previous code
$('.classSelector').get().map(function(v){return v.outerHTML}).join('');

359,14521108,950087,How do I include a JavaScript file in another JavaScript file?,"
Is there something in JavaScript similar to @import in CSS that allows you to include a JavaScript file inside another JavaScript file?
","3,337,994",5383,1570,javascript file import include ,https://stackoverflow.com/questions/950087/how-do-i-include-a-javascript-file-in-another-javascript-file,62,"
The old versions of JavaScript had no import, include, or require, so many different approaches to this problem have been developed.
But since 2015 (ES6), JavaScript has had the ES6 modules standard to import modules in Node.js, which is also supported by most modern browsers.
For compatibility with older browsers, build tools like Webpack and Rollup and/or transpilation tools like Babel can be used.
ES6 Modules
ECMAScript (ES6) modules have been supported in Node.js since v8.5, with the --experimental-modules flag, and since at least Node.js v13.8.0 without the flag. To enable ""ESM"" (vs. Node.js's previous CommonJS-style module system [""CJS""]) you either use ""type"": ""module"" in package.json or give the files the extension .mjs. (Similarly, modules written with Node.js's previous CJS module can be named .cjs if your default is ESM.)
Using package.json:
{
    ""type"": ""module""
}

Then module.js:
export function hello() {
  return ""Hello"";
}

Then main.js:
import { hello } from './module.js';
let val = hello();  // val is ""Hello"";

Using .mjs, you'd have module.mjs:
export function hello() {
  return ""Hello"";
}

Then main.mjs:
import { hello } from './module.mjs';
let val = hello();  // val is ""Hello"";

ECMAScript modules in browsers
Browsers have had support for loading ECMAScript modules directly (no tools like Webpack required) since Safari 10.1, Chrome 61, Firefox 60, and Edge 16. Check the current support at caniuse. There is no need to use Node.js' .mjs extension; browsers completely ignore file extensions on modules/scripts.
<script type=""module"">
  import { hello } from './hello.mjs'; // Or it could be simply `hello.js`
  hello('world');
</script>

// hello.mjs -- or it could be simply `hello.js`
export function hello(text) {
  const div = document.createElement('div');
  div.textContent = `Hello ${text}`;
  document.body.appendChild(div);
}

Read more at https://jakearchibald.com/2017/es-modules-in-browsers/
Dynamic imports in browsers
Dynamic imports let the script load other scripts as needed:
<script type=""module"">
  import('hello.mjs').then(module => {
      module.hello('world');
    });
</script>

Read more at https://developers.google.com/web/updates/2017/11/dynamic-import
Node.js require
The older CJS module style, still widely used in Node.js, is the module.exports/require system.
// mymodule.js
module.exports = {
   hello: function() {
      return ""Hello"";
   }
}

// server.js
const myModule = require('./mymodule');
let val = myModule.hello(); // val is ""Hello""   

There are other ways for JavaScript to include external JavaScript contents in browsers that do not require preprocessing.
AJAX Loading
You could load an additional script with an AJAX call and then use eval to run it. This is the most straightforward way, but it is limited to your domain because of the JavaScript sandbox security model. Using eval also opens the door to bugs, hacks and security issues.
Fetch Loading
Like Dynamic Imports you can load one or many scripts with a fetch call using promises to control order of execution for script dependencies using the Fetch Inject library:
fetchInject([
  'https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/momentjs/2.17.1/moment.min.js'
]).then(() => {
  console.log(`Finish in less than ${moment().endOf('year').fromNow(true)}`)
})

jQuery Loading
The jQuery library provides loading functionality in one line:
$.getScript(""my_lovely_script.js"", function() {
   alert(""Script loaded but not necessarily executed."");
});

Dynamic Script Loading
You could add a script tag with the script URL into the HTML. To avoid the overhead of jQuery, this is an ideal solution.
The script can even reside on a different server. Furthermore, the browser evaluates the code. The <script> tag can be injected into either the web page <head>, or inserted just before the closing </body> tag.
Here is an example of how this could work:
function dynamicallyLoadScript(url) {
    var script = document.createElement(""script"");  // create a script DOM node
    script.src = url;  // set its src to the provided URL

    document.head.appendChild(script);  // add it to the end of the head section of the page (could change 'head' to 'body' to add it to the end of the body section instead)
}

This function will add a new <script> tag to the end of the head section of the page, where the src attribute is set to the URL which is given to the function as the first parameter.
Both of these solutions are discussed and illustrated in JavaScript Madness: Dynamic Script Loading.
Detecting when the script has been executed
Now, there is a big issue you must know about. Doing that implies that you remotely load the code. Modern web browsers will load the file and keep executing your current script because they load everything asynchronously to improve performance. (This applies to both the jQuery method and the manual dynamic script loading method.)
It means that if you use these tricks directly, you won't be able to use your newly loaded code the next line after you asked it to be loaded, because it will be still loading.
For example: my_lovely_script.js contains MySuperObject:
var js = document.createElement(""script"");

js.type = ""text/javascript"";
js.src = jsFilePath;

document.body.appendChild(js);

var s = new MySuperObject();

Error : MySuperObject is undefined

Then you reload the page hitting F5. And it works! Confusing...
So what to do about it ?
Well, you can use the hack the author suggests in the link I gave you. In summary, for people in a hurry, he uses an event to run a callback function when the script is loaded. So you can put all the code using the remote library in the callback function. For example:
function loadScript(url, callback)
{
    // Adding the script tag to the head as suggested before
    var head = document.head;
    var script = document.createElement('script');
    script.type = 'text/javascript';
    script.src = url;

    // Then bind the event to the callback function.
    // There are several events for cross browser compatibility.
    script.onreadystatechange = callback;
    script.onload = callback;

    // Fire the loading
    head.appendChild(script);
}

Then you write the code you want to use AFTER the script is loaded in a lambda function:
var myPrettyCode = function() {
   // Here, do whatever you want
};

Then you run all that:
loadScript(""my_lovely_script.js"", myPrettyCode);

Note that the script may execute after the DOM has loaded, or before, depending on the browser and whether you included the line script.async = false;. There's a great article on Javascript loading in general which discusses this.
Source Code Merge/Preprocessing
As mentioned at the top of this answer, many developers use build/transpilation tool(s) like Parcel, Webpack, or Babel in their projects, allowing them to use upcoming JavaScript syntax, provide backward compatibility for older browsers, combine files, minify, perform code splitting etc.
",4615,"
If anyone is looking for something more advanced, try out RequireJS. You'll get added benefits such as dependency management, better concurrency, and avoid duplication (that is, retrieving a script more than once).
You can write your JavaScript files in ""modules"" and then reference them as dependencies in other scripts. Or you can use RequireJS as a simple ""go get this script"" solution.
Example:
Define dependencies as modules:
some-dependency.js
define(['lib/dependency1', 'lib/dependency2'], function (d1, d2) {

     //Your actual script goes here.   
     //The dependent scripts will be fetched if necessary.

     return libraryObject;  //For example, jQuery object
});

implementation.js is your ""main"" JavaScript file that depends on some-dependency.js
require(['some-dependency'], function(dependency) {

    //Your script goes here
    //some-dependency.js is fetched.   
    //Then your script is executed
});

Excerpt from the GitHub README:

RequireJS loads plain JavaScript files as well as more defined
  modules. It is optimized for in-browser use, including in a Web
  Worker, but it can be used in other JavaScript environments, like
  Rhino and Node. It implements the Asynchronous Module API.
RequireJS uses plain script tags to load modules/files, so it should
  allow for easy debugging. It can be used simply to load existing
  JavaScript files, so you can add it to your existing project without
  having to re-write your JavaScript files.

360,716477,952914,How to make a flat list out of list of lists?,"
I wonder whether there is a shortcut to make a simple list out of list of lists in Python.
I can do that in a for loop, but maybe there is some cool ""one-liner""? I tried it with reduce(), but I get an error.
Code
l = [[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6], [7], [8, 9]]
reduce(lambda x, y: x.extend(y), l)

Error message

","2,434,758",3671,1141,python list multidimensional-array flatten ,https://stackoverflow.com/questions/952914/how-to-make-a-flat-list-out-of-list-of-lists,43,"
Given a list of lists t,
flat_list = [item for sublist in t for item in sublist]
which means:
flat_list = []
for sublist in t:
    for item in sublist:
        flat_list.append(item)

is faster than the shortcuts posted so far. (t is the list to flatten.)
Here is the corresponding function:
flatten = lambda t: [item for sublist in t for item in sublist]

As evidence, you can use the timeit module in the standard library:
$ python -mtimeit -s't=[[1,2,3],[4,5,6], [7], [8,9]]*99' '[item for sublist in t for item in sublist]'
10000 loops, best of 3: 143 usec per loop
$ python -mtimeit -s't=[[1,2,3],[4,5,6], [7], [8,9]]*99' 'sum(t, [])'
1000 loops, best of 3: 969 usec per loop
$ python -mtimeit -s't=[[1,2,3],[4,5,6], [7], [8,9]]*99' 'reduce(lambda x,y: x+y,t)'
1000 loops, best of 3: 1.1 msec per loop

Explanation: the shortcuts based on + (including the implied use in sum) are, of necessity, O(T**2) when there are T sublists -- as the intermediate result list keeps getting longer, at each step a new intermediate result list object gets allocated, and all the items in the previous intermediate result must be copied over (as well as a few new ones added at the end). So, for simplicity and without actual loss of generality, say you have T sublists of k items each: the first k items are copied back and forth T-1 times, the second k items T-2 times, and so on; total number of copies is k times the sum of x for x from 1 to T excluded, i.e., k * (T**2)/2.
The list comprehension just generates one list, once, and copies each item over (from its original place of residence to the result list) also exactly once.
",5212,"
You can use itertools.chain():
import itertools
list2d = [[1,2,3], [4,5,6], [7], [8,9]]
merged = list(itertools.chain(*list2d))

Or you can use itertools.chain.from_iterable() which doesn't require unpacking the list with the * operator:
import itertools
list2d = [[1,2,3], [4,5,6], [7], [8,9]]
merged = list(itertools.chain.from_iterable(list2d))

DataFrame.iterrows is a generator which yields both the index and row (as a Series):

df = pd.DataFrame({'c1': [10, 11, 12], 'c2': [100, 110, 120]})

How to iterate over rows in a DataFrame in Pandas?

Answer: DON'T*!
Iteration in Pandas is an anti-pattern and is something you should only do when you have exhausted every other option. You should not use any function with ""iter"" in its name for more than a few thousand rows or you will have to get used to a lot of waiting.
Do you want to print a DataFrame? Use DataFrame.to_string().
Do you want to compute something? In that case, search for methods in this order (list modified from here):

Vectorization
Cython routines
List Comprehensions (vanilla for loop)
DataFrame.apply(): i)  Reductions that can be performed in Cython, ii) Iteration in Python space
DataFrame.itertuples() and iteritems()
DataFrame.iterrows()

iterrows and itertuples (both receiving many votes in answers to this question) should be used in very rare circumstances, such as generating row objects/nametuples for sequential processing, which is really the only thing these functions are useful for.
Appeal to Authority
The documentation page on iteration has a huge red warning box that says:

Iterating through pandas objects is generally slow. In many cases, iterating manually over the rows is not needed [...].

* It's actually a little more complicated than ""don't"". df.iterrows() is the correct answer to this question, but ""vectorize your ops"" is the better one. I will concede that there are circumstances where iteration cannot be avoided (for example, some operations where the result depends on the value computed for the previous row). However, it takes some familiarity with the library to know when. If you're not sure whether you need an iterative solution, you probably don't. PS: To know more about my rationale for writing this answer, skip to the very bottom.

Faster than Looping: Vectorization, Cython
A good number of basic operations and computations are ""vectorised"" by pandas (either through NumPy, or through Cythonized functions). This includes arithmetic, comparisons, (most) reductions, reshaping (such as pivoting), joins, and groupby operations. Look through the documentation on Essential Basic Functionality to find a suitable vectorised method for your problem.
If none exists, feel free to write your own using custom Cython extensions.

Next Best Thing: List Comprehensions*
List comprehensions should be your next port of call if 1) there is no vectorized solution available, 2) performance is important, but not important enough to go through the hassle of cythonizing your code, and 3) you're trying to perform elementwise transformation on your code. There is a good amount of evidence to suggest that list comprehensions are sufficiently fast (and even sometimes faster) for many common Pandas tasks.
The formula is simple,
# Iterating over one column - `f` is some function that processes your data
result = [f(x) for x in df['col']]
# Iterating over two columns, use `zip`
result = [f(x, y) for x, y in zip(df['col1'], df['col2'])]
# Iterating over multiple columns - same data type
result = [f(row[0], ..., row[n]) for row in df[['col1', ...,'coln']].to_numpy()]
# Iterating over multiple columns - differing data type
result = [f(row[0], ..., row[n]) for row in zip(df['col1'], ..., df['coln'])]

If you can encapsulate your business logic into a function, you can use a list comprehension that calls it. You can make arbitrarily complex things work through the simplicity and speed of raw Python code.
Caveats
List comprehensions assume that your data is easy to work with - what that means is your data types are consistent and you don't have NaNs, but this cannot always be guaranteed.

The first one is more obvious, but when dealing with NaNs, prefer in-built pandas methods if they exist (because they have much better corner-case handling logic), or ensure your business logic includes appropriate NaN handling logic.
When dealing with mixed data types you should iterate over zip(df['A'], df['B'], ...) instead of df[['A', 'B']].to_numpy() as the latter implicitly upcasts data to the most common type. As an example if A is numeric and B is string, to_numpy() will cast the entire array to string, which may not be what you want. Fortunately zipping your columns together is the most straightforward workaround to this.

*Your mileage may vary for the reasons outlined in the Caveats section above.

An Obvious Example
Let's demonstrate the difference with a simple example of adding two pandas columns A + B. This is a vectorizable operaton, so it will be easy to contrast the performance of the methods discussed above.

Benchmarking code, for your reference. The line at the bottom measures a function written in numpandas, a style of Pandas that mixes heavily with NumPy to squeeze out maximum performance. Writing numpandas code should be avoided unless you know what you're doing. Stick to the API where you can (i.e., prefer vec over vec_numpy).
I should mention, however, that it isn't always this cut and dry. Sometimes the answer to ""what is the best method for an operation"" is ""it depends on your data"". My advice is to test out different approaches on your data before settling on one.

Enhancing Performance - A primer from the documentation on enhancing standard Pandas operations

Are for-loops in pandas really bad? When should I care? - a detailed writeup by me on list comprehensions and their suitability for various operations (mainly ones involving non-numeric data)

When should I ever want to use pandas apply() in my code? - apply is slow (but not as slow as the iter* family. There are, however, situations where one can (or should) consider apply as a serious alternative, especially in some GroupBy operations).


* Pandas string methods are ""vectorized"" in the sense that they are specified on the series but operate on each element. The underlying mechanisms are still iterative, because string operations are inherently hard to vectorize.

Why I Wrote this Answer
A common trend I notice from new users is to ask questions of the form ""How can I iterate over my df to do X?"". Showing code that calls iterrows() while doing something inside a for loop. Here is why. A new user to the library who has not been introduced to the concept of vectorization will likely envision the code that solves their problem as iterating over their data to do something. Not knowing how to iterate over a DataFrame, the first thing they do is Google it and end up here, at this question. They then see the accepted answer telling them how to, and they close their eyes and run this code without ever first questioning if iteration is not the right thing to do.
The aim of this answer is to help new users understand that iteration is not necessarily the solution to every problem, and that better, faster and more idiomatic solutions could exist, and that it is worth investing time in exploring them. I'm not trying to start a war of iteration vs. vectorization, but I want new users to be informed when developing solutions to their problems with this library.

string.Equals
Determines whether this instance and a specified object, which must also be a String object, have the same value.
string.Compare
Compares two specified String objects and returns an integer that indicates their relative position in the sort order.
string.CompareTo
Compares this instance with a specified object or String and returns an integer that indicates whether this instance precedes, follows, or appears in the same position in the sort order as the specified object or String.
string.CompareOrdinal
Compares two specified String objects by evaluating the numeric values of the corresponding Char objects in each string.
String equality operators
The predefined string equality operators are:
bool operator ==(string x, string y);
bool operator !=(string x, string y);
Two string values are considered equal when one of the following is true:
Both values are null.
Both values are non-null references to string instances that have identical lengths and identical characters in each character position.
The string equality operators compare string values rather than string references. When two separate string instances contain the exact same sequence of characters, the values of the strings are equal, but the references are different. As described in Section 7.9.6, the reference type equality operators can be used to compare string references instead of string values.

369,1472498,793100,Globally catch exceptions in a WPF application?,"
We are having a WPF application where parts of it may throw exceptions at runtime. I'd like to globally catch any unhandled exception and log them, but otherwise continue program execution as if nothing happened (kinda like VB's On Error Resume Next).
Is this possible in C#? And if so, where exactly would I need to put the exception handling code?
Currently I can't see any single point where I could wrap a try/catch around and which would catch all exceptions that could occur. And even then I would have left whatever has been executed because of the catch. Or am I thinking in horribly wrong directions here?
ETA: Because many people below pointed it out: The application is not for controlling nuclear power plants. If it crashes it's not that much a big deal but random exceptions that are mostly UI-related are a nuisance in the context where it would be used. There were (and probably still are) a few of those and since it uses a plugin architecture and may be extended by others (also students in that case; so no experienced developers that are able to write completely error-free code).
As for the exceptions that get caught: I do log them to a log file, including the complete stack trace. That was the whole point of that exercise. Just to counter those people  that were taking my analogy to VB's OERN too literally.
I know that blindly ignoring certain classes of errors is dangerous and might corrupt my application instance. As said before, this program isn't mission-critical for anyone. No-one in their right mind would bet the survival of the human civilization on it. It's simply a little tool for testing certain design approaches wrt. software engineering.
For the immediate use of the application there are not many things that can happen on an exception:

No exception handling – error dialog and application exit. Experiment has to be repeated, though likely with another subject. No errors have been logged, which is unfortunate.
Generic exception handling – benign error trapped, no harm done. This should be the common case judged from all errors we were seeing during development. Ignoring this kind of errors should have no immediate consequences; the core data structures are tested well enough that they will easily survive this.
Generic exception handling – serious error trapped, possibly crash at a later point. This may happen rarely. We've never seen it so far. The error is logged anyway and a crash might be inevitable. So this is conceptually similar to the very first case. Except that we have a stack trace. And in the majority of cases the user won't even notice.

As for the experiment data generated by the program: A serious error would at worst just cause no data to be recorded. Subtle changes that change the result of the experiment ever so slightly are pretty unlikely. And even in that case, if the results seem dubious the error was logged; one can still throw away that data point if it's a total outlier.
To summarize: Yes, I consider myself still at least partially sane and I don't consider a global exception handling routine which leaves the program running to be necessarily totally evil. As said twice before, such a decision might be valid, depending on the application. In this case it was judged a valid decision and not total and utter bullshit. For any other application that decision might look different. But please don't accuse me or the other people who worked on that project to potentially blow up the world just because we're ignoring errors.
Side note: There is exactly one user for that application. It's not something like Windows or Office that gets used by millions where the cost of having exceptions bubble to the user at all would be very different in the first place already.

As you've guessed, the right syntax is

It's difficult to make del df.column_name work simply as the result of syntactic limitations in Python. del df[name] gets translated to df.__delitem__(name) under the covers by Python.

The best way to do this in pandas is to use drop:
df = df.drop('column_name', 1)

where 1 is the axis number (0 for rows and 1 for columns.)
To delete the column without having to reassign df you can do:
df.drop('column_name', axis=1, inplace=True)

Finally, to drop by column number instead of by column label, try this to delete, e.g. the 1st, 2nd and 4th columns:
df = df.drop(df.columns[[0, 1, 3]], axis=1)  # df.columns is zero-based pd.Index 

Also working with ""text"" syntax for the columns:
df.drop(['column_nameA', 'column_nameB'], axis=1, inplace=True)

Note: Introduced in v0.21.0 (October 27, 2017), the drop() method accepts index/columns keywords as an alternative to specifying the axis.

Update for 2020: Sticking to the original question of 16x16 versus 32x32 icons: the current recommendation should be to provide a 32x32 icon, skipping 16x16 entirely. All current browsers and devices support 32x32 icons. The icon will routinely be upscaled to as much as 192x192 depending on the environment (assuming there are no larger sizes available or the system didn't recognize them). Upscaling from ultra low resolution has a noticeable effect so better stick to 32x32 as the smallest baseline.

For IE, Microsoft recommends 16x16, 32x32 and 48x48 packed in the favicon.ico file.
For iOS, Apple recommends specific file names and resolutions, at most 180x180 for latest devices running iOS 8.
Android Chrome primarily uses a manifest and also relies on the Apple touch icon.
IE 10 on Windows 8.0 requires PNG pictures and a background color and IE 11 on Windows 8.1 and 10 accepts several PNG pictures declared in a dedicated XML file called browserconfig.xml.
Safari for Mac OS X El Capitan introduces an SVG icon for pinned tabs.
Some other platforms look for PNG files with various resolutions, like the 96x96 picture for Google TV or the 228x228 picture for Opera Coast.
Look at this favicon pictures list for a complete reference.
TLDR: This favicon generator can generate all these files at once. The generator can also be implemented as a WordPress plugin. Full disclosure: I am the author of this site.

When == is used on an expression of type object, it'll resolve to System.Object.ReferenceEquals.
Equals is just a virtual method and behaves as such, so the overridden version will be used (which, for string type compares the contents).
",445,"
When comparing an object reference to a string (even if the object reference refers to a string), the special behavior of the == operator specific to the string class is ignored.
Normally (when not dealing with strings, that is), Equals compares values, while == compares object references.
If two objects you are comparing are referring to the same exact instance of an object, then both will return true, but if one has the same content and came from a different source (is a separate instance with the same data), only Equals will return true. However, as noted in the comments, string is a special case because it overrides the == operator so that when dealing purely with string references (and not object references), only the values are compared even if they are separate instances. The following code illustrates the subtle differences in behaviors:
string s1 = ""test"";
string s2 = ""test"";
string s3 = ""test1"".Substring(0, 4);
object s4 = s3;
Console.WriteLine(""{0} {1} {2}"", object.ReferenceEquals(s1, s2), s1 == s2, s1.Equals(s2));

How do you use the CSS content property to add HTML entities?
Using something like this just prints &nbsp; to the screen instead of the non-breaking space:
.breadcrumbs a:before {
    content: '&nbsp;';
}

","445,827",1035,227,html css html-entities css-content ,https://stackoverflow.com/questions/190396/adding-html-entities-using-css-content,9,"
You have to use the escaped unicode :
Like 
.breadcrumbs a:before {
    content: '\0000a0';
}

More info on : http://www.evotech.net/blog/2007/04/named-html-entities-in-numeric-order/
",1085,"
CSS is not HTML.  &nbsp; is a named character reference in HTML; equivalent to the decimal numeric character reference &#160;.  160 is the decimal code point of the NO-BREAK SPACE character in Unicode (or UCS-2; see the HTML 4.01 Specification).  The hexadecimal representation of that code point is U+00A0 (160 = 10 × 161 + 0 × 160). You will find that in the Unicode Code Charts and Character Database.
In CSS you need to use a Unicode escape sequence for such characters, which is based on the hexadecimal value of the code point of a character. So you need to write
.breadcrumbs a:before {
  content: '\a0';
}

This works as long as the escape sequence comes last in a string value.  If characters follow, there are two ways to avoid misinterpretation:
a) (mentioned by others) Use exactly six hexadecimal digits for the escape sequence:
.breadcrumbs a:before {
  content: '\0000a0foo';
}

b) Add one white-space (e. g., space) character after the escape sequence:
.breadcrumbs a:before {
  content: '\a0 foo';
}

(Since f is a hexadecimal digit, \a0f would otherwise mean GURMUKHI LETTER EE here, or ਏ if you have a suitable font.)
The delimiting white-space will be ignored, and this will be displayed  foo, where the displayed space here would be a NO-BREAK SPACE character.
The white-space approach ('\a0 foo') has the following advantages over the six-digit approach ('\0000a0foo'):

it is easier to type, because leading zeroes are not necessary, and digits do not need to be counted;
it is easier to read, because there is white-space between escape sequence and following text, and digits do not need to be counted;
it requires less space, because leading zeroes are not necessary;
it is upwards-compatible, because Unicode supporting code points beyond U+10FFFF in the future would require a modification of the CSS Specification.

Thus, to display a space after an escaped character, use two spaces in the stylesheet –
.breadcrumbs a:before {
  content: '\a0  foo';
}

– or make it explicit:
.breadcrumbs a:before {
  content: '\a0\20 foo';
}

See CSS 2.1, section ""4.1.3 Characters and case"" for details.

2017 — 2019 update
Since 2009 when this question was asked, JavaScript has evolved significantly. All other answers are now obsolete or overly complicated. Here is the current best practice:


function sleep(ms) {
  return new Promise(resolve => setTimeout(resolve, ms));
}

async function demo() {
  console.log('Taking a break...');
  await sleep(2000);
  console.log('Two seconds later, showing sleep in a loop...');

  // Sleep in loop
  for (let i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
    if (i === 3)
      await sleep(2000);
    console.log(i);
  }
}

demo();



This is it. await sleep(<duration>).
Or as a one-liner:
await new Promise(r => setTimeout(r, 2000));

Note that,

await can only be executed in functions prefixed with the async keyword, or at the top level of your script in some environments (e.g. the Chrome DevTools console, or Runkit).
await only pauses the current async function

Two new JavaScript features helped write this ""sleep"" function:

Promises, a native feature of ES2015 (aka ES6). We also use arrow functions in the definition of the sleep function.
The async/await feature lets the code explicitly wait for a promise to settle (resolve or reject).

Compatibility

promises are supported in Node v0.12+ and widely supported in browsers, except IE
async/await landed in V8 and has been enabled by default since Chrome 55 (released in Dec 2016)


it landed in Node 7 in October 2016
and also landed in Firefox Nightly in November 2016


If for some weird reason you're using Node older than 7 (which has reached end of life), or are targeting old browsers, async/await can still be used via Babel (a tool that will transpile JavaScript + new features into plain old JavaScript), with the transform-async-to-generator plugin.
",2925,"
(See the updated answer for 2016)
I think it's perfectly reasonable to want to perform an action, wait, then perform another action. If you are used to writing in multi-threaded languages, you probably have the idea of yielding execution for a set amount of time until your thread wakes up.
The issue here is that JavaScript is a single-thread event-based model. While in a specific case, it might be nice to have the whole engine wait for a few seconds, in general it is bad practice. Suppose I wanted to make use of your functions while writing my own? When I called your method, my methods would all freeze up. If JavaScript could somehow preserve your function's execution context, store it somewhere, then bring it back and continue later, then sleep could happen, but that would basically be threading.
So you are pretty much stuck with what others have suggested -- you'll need to break your code up into multiple functions.
Your question is a bit of a false choice, then. There is no way to sleep in the way you want, nor should you pursue the solution you suggest.

The Stopwatch class, available since .NET 2.0, is the best way to go for this. It is a very high performance counter accurate to fractions of a millisecond.
Take a look at the MSDN documentation, which is pretty clear.

Execute your code repeatedly. The problem seems to be that your code executes a lot faster than the granularity of your measuring instrument. The simplest solution to this is to execute your code many, many times (thousands, maybe millions) and then calculate the average execution time.
Edit: Also, due to the nature of current optimizing compilers (and Virtual Machines such as the CLR and the JVM) it can be very misleading to measure the execution speed of single lines of code, since the measurement can influence the speed quite a lot. A much better approach would be to profile the entire system (or at least larger blocks) and check where the bottlenecks are.

Lookup tables have taken the lead over byte manipulation. Basically, there is some form of precomputing what any given nibble or byte will be in hex. Then, as you rip through the data, you simply look up the next portion to see what hex string it would be. That value is then added to the resulting string output in some fashion. For a long time byte manipulation, potentially harder to read by some developers, was the top-performing approach.
Your best bet is still going to be finding some representative data and trying it out in a production-like environment. If you have different memory constraints, you may prefer a method with fewer allocations to one that would be faster but consume more memory.

Add that method's name to the TestCandidates return value in that same class.
Make sure you are running the input version you want, sentence or text, by toggling the comments in GenerateTestInput in that same class.
Hit F5 and wait for the output (an HTML dump is also generated in the /bin folder).

Update (2010-01-13)
Added Waleed's answer to analysis. Quite fast.
Update (2011-10-05)
Added string.Concat Array.ConvertAll variant for completeness (requires .NET 4.0). On par with string.Join version.
Update (2012-02-05)
Test repo includes more variants such as StringBuilder.Append(b.ToString(""X2"")). None upset the results any. foreach is faster than {IEnumerable}.Aggregate, for instance, but BitConverter still wins.
Update (2012-04-03)
Added Mykroft's SoapHexBinary answer to analysis, which took over third place.
Update (2013-01-15)
Added CodesInChaos's byte manipulation answer, which took over first place (by a large margin on large blocks of text).
Update (2013-05-23)
Added Nathan Moinvaziri's lookup answer and the variant from Brian Lambert's blog. Both rather fast, but not taking the lead on the test machine I used (AMD Phenom 9750).
Update (2014-07-31)
Added @CodesInChaos's new byte-based lookup answer. It appears to have taken the lead on both the sentence tests and the full-text tests.
Update (2015-08-20)
Added airbreather's optimizations and unsafe variant to this answer's repo. If you want to play in the unsafe game, you can get some huge performance gains over any of the prior top winners on both short strings and large texts.

380,623052,8182858,Mercurial: how to amend the last commit?,"
I'm looking for a counter-part of git commit --amend in Mercurial, i.e. a way to modify the commit which my working copy is linked to. I'm only interested in the last commit, not an arbitrary earlier commit.
The requirements for this amend-procedure are:

if possible, it should not require any extensions. It must not require non-default extensions, i.e. extensions which do not come with an official Mercurial installation.
if the commit to amend is one head of my current branch, no new head should be created. If the commit is not head, a new head may be created.
the procedure should be safe in a way that if for whatever reasons the amending fails, I want to have the same working copy and repository state restored as before the amending. With other words, if the amending itself can fail, there should be a fail-safe procedure to restore the working copy and repository state. I'm referring to ""failures"" which lie in the nature of the amend-procedure (like e.g. conflicts), not to file-system-related problems (like access restrictions, not being able to lock a file for writing, ...)

Update (1):

the procedure must be automatable, so it can be performed by a GUI client without any user interaction required.

Update (2):

files in the working directory must not be touched (there may be file system locks on certain modified files). This especially means, that a possible approach may at no point require a clean working directory.

","101,892",212,42,mercurial commit amend mercurial-commit ,https://stackoverflow.com/questions/8182858/mercurial-how-to-amend-the-last-commit,8,"
With the release of Mercurial 2.2, you can use the --amend option with hg commit to update the last commit with the current working directory
From the command line reference:

The --amend flag can be used to amend the parent of the working directory with a new commit that contains the changes in the parent in addition to those currently reported by hg status, if there are any. The old commit is stored in a backup bundle in .hg/strip-backup (see hg help bundle and hg help unbundle on how to restore it).
Message, user and date are taken from the amended commit unless specified. When a message isn't specified on the command line, the editor will open with the message of the amended commit.

The great thing is that this mechanism is ""safe"", because it relies on the relatively new ""Phases"" feature to prevent updates that would change history that's already been made available outside of the local repository.
",289,"
You have 3 options to edit commits in Mercurial:

hg strip --keep --rev -1 undo the last (1) commit(s), so you can do it again (see this answer for more information).
Using the MQ extension, which is shipped with Mercurial 
Even if it isn't shipped with Mercurial, the Histedit extension is worth mentioning

You can also have a look on the Editing History page of the Mercurial wiki.
In short, editing history is really hard and discouraged. And if you've already pushed your changes, there's barely nothing you can do, except if you have total control of all the other clones.
I'm not really familiar with the git commit --amend command, but AFAIK, Histedit is what seems to be the closest approach, but sadly it isn't shipped with Mercurial. MQ is really complicated to use, but you can do nearly anything with it.

381,20358883,1005073,Initialization of an ArrayList in one line,"
I wanted to create a list of options for testing purposes. At first, I did this:
ArrayList<String> places = new ArrayList<String>();
places.add(""Buenos Aires"");
places.add(""Córdoba"");
places.add(""La Plata"");

Then, I refactored the code as follows:
ArrayList<String> places = new ArrayList<String>(
    Arrays.asList(""Buenos Aires"", ""Córdoba"", ""La Plata""));

Is there a better way to do this?
","3,061,172",2845,586,java collections arraylist initialization ,https://stackoverflow.com/questions/1005073/initialization-of-an-arraylist-in-one-line,31,"
Actually, probably the ""best"" way to initialize the ArrayList is the method you wrote, as it does not need to create a new List in any way:
ArrayList<String> list = new ArrayList<String>();
list.add(""A"");
list.add(""B"");
list.add(""C"");

The catch is that there is quite a bit of typing required to refer to that list instance.
There are alternatives, such as making an anonymous inner class with an instance initializer (also known as an ""double brace initialization""):
ArrayList<String> list = new ArrayList<String>() {{
    add(""A"");
    add(""B"");
    add(""C"");
}};

However, I'm not too fond of that method because what you end up with is a subclass of ArrayList which has an instance initializer, and that class is created just to create one object -- that just seems like a little bit overkill to me.
What would have been nice was if the Collection Literals proposal for Project Coin was accepted (it was slated to be introduced in Java 7, but it's not likely to be part of Java 8 either.):
List<String> list = [""A"", ""B"", ""C""];

Unfortunately it won't help you here, as it will initialize an immutable List rather than an ArrayList, and furthermore, it's not available yet, if it ever will be.
",2089,"
It would be simpler if you were to just declare it as a List - does it have to be an ArrayList?
List<String> places = Arrays.asList(""Buenos Aires"", ""Córdoba"", ""La Plata"");

Or if you have only one element:
List<String> places = Collections.singletonList(""Buenos Aires"");

This would mean that places is immutable (trying to change it will cause an UnsupportedOperationException exception to be thrown).
To make a mutable list that is a concrete ArrayList you can create an ArrayList from the immutable list:
ArrayList<String> places = new ArrayList<>(Arrays.asList(""Buenos Aires"", ""Córdoba"", ""La Plata""));

Babel is a transformation framework. Pre-6.x, it enabled certain transformations by default, but with the increased usage of Node versions which natively support many ES6 features, it has become much more important that things be configurable. By default, Babel 6.x does not perform any transformations. You need to tell it what transformations to run:
npm install babel-preset-env

and run
babel --presets env proxy.js --out-file proxified.js

or create a .babelrc file containing
{
    ""presets"": [
        ""env""
    ]
}

and run it just like you were before.
env in this case is a preset which basically says to compile all standard ES* behavior to ES5. If you are using Node versions that support some ES6, you may want to consider doing
{
    ""presets"": [
        [""env"", { ""targets"": { ""node"": ""true"" } }],
    ]
}

to tell the preset to only process things that are not supported by your Node version. You can also include browser versions in your targets if you need browser support.

Im using Python 2.7.3 and Requests. I installed Requests via pip. I believe it's the latest version. I'm running on Debian Wheezy.
I've used Requests lots of times in the past and never faced this issue, but it seems that when making https requests with Requests I get an InsecurePlatform exception.
The error mentions urllib3, but I don't have that installed. I did install it to check if it resolved the error, but it didn't.

Use the somewhat hidden security feature:
pip install requests[security]
or
pip install pyOpenSSL ndg-httpsclient pyasn1 
Both commands install following extra packages:

pyOpenSSL
cryptography

Please note that this is not required for python-2.7.9+.
If pip install fails with errors, check whether you have required development packages for libffi, libssl and python installed in your system using distribution's package manager:

Debian/Ubuntu - python-dev libffi-dev libssl-dev packages.
Fedora - openssl-devel python-devel libffi-devel packages.

Distro list above is incomplete.
Workaround (see the original answer by @TomDotTom):
In case you cannot install some of the required development packages, there's also an option to disable that warning:
import requests.packages.urllib3
requests.packages.urllib3.disable_warnings()

If your pip itself is affected by InsecurePlatformWarning and cannot install anything from PyPI, it can be fixed with this step-by-step guide to deploy extra python packages manually.

Requests 2.6 introduced this warning for users of python prior to 2.7.9 with only stock SSL modules available.
Assuming you can't upgrade to a newer version of python, this will install more up-to-date python SSL libraries:

HOWEVER, this may fail on some systems without the build-dependencies for pyOpenSSL. On debian systems, running this before the pip command above should be enough for pyOpenSSL to build:

Use itertools.islice:
list(itertools.islice(it, n))

",68,"
EDIT: Use itertools.islice.  The pattern below that I originally proposed is bad idea — it crashes when it yields less than n values, and this behaviour depends on subtle issues, so people reading such code are unlikely to understand it's precise semantics.

There is also
[next(it) for _ in range(n)]

which might(?) be clearer to people not familiar with itertools; but if you deal with iterators a lot, itertools is a worthy addition to your toolset.

What happens if next(it) was exhausted and raises StopIteration?
(i.e. when it had less than n values to yield)
When I wrote the above line a couple years ago, I probably thought a StopIteration will have the clever side effect of cleanly terminating the list comprehension.  But no, the whole comprehension will crash passing the StopIteration upwards.  (It'd exit cleanly only if the exception originated from the range(n) iterator.)
Which is probably not the behavior you want.
But it gets worse.  The following is supposed to be equivalent to the list comprehension (especially on Python 3):
list(next(it) for _ in range(n))

It isn't.  The inner part is shorthand for a generator function; list() knows it's done when it raises StopIteration anywhere.
=> This version copes safely when there aren't n values and returns a shorter list.  (Like itertools.islice().)
[Executions on: 2.7, 3.4]
But that's too going to change!  The fact a generator silently exits when any code inside it raises StopIteration is a known wart, addressed by PEP 479.  From Python 3.7 (or 3.5 with a future import) that's going to cause a RuntimeError instead of cleanly finishing the generator.  I.e. it'll become similar to the list comprehension's behaviour.

I have a script named test1.py which is not in a module. It just has code that should execute when the script itself is run. There are no functions, classes, methods, etc. I have another script which runs as a service. I want to call test1.py from the script running as a service.
For example:
File test1.py
print ""I am a test""
print ""see! I do nothing productive.""

File service.py
# Lots of stuff here
test1.py # do whatever is in test1.py

I'm aware of one method which is opening the file, reading the contents, and basically eval'ing it. I'm assuming there's a better way of doing this. Or at least I hope so.

The usual way to do this is something like the following.
test1.py
def some_func():
    print 'in test 1, unproductive'

if __name__ == '__main__':
    # test1.py executed as script
    # do something
    some_func()

def service_func():
    print 'service func'

if __name__ == '__main__':
    # service.py executed as script
    # do something
    service_func()
    test1.some_func()

",305,"
This is possible in Python 2 using
execfile(""test2.py"")

See the documentation for the handling of namespaces, if important in your case.
In Python 3, this is possible using (thanks to @fantastory)
exec(open(""test2.py"").read())

However, you should consider using a different approach; your idea (from what I can see) doesn't look very clean.

389,9109438,513084,Ship an application with a database,"
If your application requires a database and it comes with built in data, what is the best way to ship that application? Should I:

Precreate the SQLite database and include it in the .apk?
Include the SQL commands with the application and have it create the database and insert the data on first use?

The drawbacks I see are:

Possible SQLite version mismatches might cause problems and I currently don't know where the database should go and how to access it.
It may take a really long time to create and populate the database on the device.

Any suggestions? Pointers to the documentation regarding any issues would be greatly appreciated.

There are two options for creating and updating databases. 
One is to create a database externally, then place it in the assets folder of the project and then copy the entire database from there.  This is much quicker if the database has a lot of tables and other components.  Upgrades are triggered by changing the database version number in the res/values/strings.xml file. Upgrades would then be accomplished by creating a new database externally, replacing the old database in the assets folder with the new database, saving the old database in internal storage under another name, copying the new database from the assets folder into internal storage, transferring all of the data from the old database (that was renamed earlier) into the new database and finally deleting the old database.  You can create a database originally by using the SQLite Manager FireFox plugin to execute your creation sql statements.
The other option is to create a database internally from a sql file.  This is not as quick but the delay would probably be unnoticeable to the users if the database has only a few tables. Upgrades are triggered by changing the database version number in the res/values/strings.xml file.  Upgrades would then be accomplished by processing an upgrade sql file.  The data in the database will remain unchanged except when its container is removed, for example dropping a table.
The example below demonstrates how to use either method.
Here is a sample create_database.sql file.  It is to be placed in the assets folder of the project for the internal method or copied into the ""Execute SQL' of SQLite Manager to create the database for the external method.  (NOTE: Notice the comment about the table required by Android.)
--Android requires a table named 'android_metadata' with a 'locale' column
CREATE TABLE ""android_metadata"" (""locale"" TEXT DEFAULT 'en_US');
INSERT INTO ""android_metadata"" VALUES ('en_US');

CREATE TABLE ""kitchen_table"";
CREATE TABLE ""coffee_table"";
CREATE TABLE ""pool_table"";
CREATE TABLE ""dining_room_table"";
CREATE TABLE ""card_table""; 

Here is a sample update_database.sql file.  It is to be placed in the assets folder of the project for the internal method or copied into the ""Execute SQL' of SQLite Manager to create the database for the external method.  (NOTE: Notice that all three types of  SQL comments will be ignored by the sql parser that is included in this example.)
--CREATE TABLE ""kitchen_table"";  This is one type of comment in sql.  It is ignored by parseSql.
/*
 * CREATE TABLE ""coffee_table""; This is a second type of comment in sql.  It is ignored by parseSql.
 */
{
CREATE TABLE ""pool_table"";  This is a third type of comment in sql.  It is ignored by parseSql.
}
/* CREATE TABLE ""dining_room_table""; This is a second type of comment in sql.  It is ignored by parseSql. */
{ CREATE TABLE ""card_table""; This is a third type of comment in sql.  It is ignored by parseSql. }

--DROP TABLE ""picnic_table""; Uncomment this if picnic table was previously created and now is being replaced.
CREATE TABLE ""picnic_table"" (""plates"" TEXT);
INSERT INTO ""picnic_table"" VALUES ('paper');

Here is an entry to add to the /res/values/strings.xml file for the database version number.
<item type=""string"" name=""databaseVersion"" format=""integer"">1</item>

Here is an activity that accesses the database and then uses it.  (Note: You might want to run the database code in a separate thread if it uses a lot of resources.)

import android.app.Activity;

        DatabaseHelper myDbHelper;

        myDbHelper = new DatabaseHelper(this);
        /*

         * that the database exists and is the current version.

         myDbHelper.initializeDataBase();

         try {
            // A reference to the database can be obtained after initialization.
            myDb = myDbHelper.getWritableDatabase();
            /*
             * Place code to use database here.

            }

You can accomplish this using the mysqldump command-line function.
For example:
If it's an entire DB, then:
   $ mysqldump -u [uname] -p db_name > db_backup.sql

If it's all DBs, then:
   $ mysqldump -u [uname] -p --all-databases > all_db_backup.sql

If it's specific tables within a DB, then:
   $ mysqldump -u [uname] -p db_name table1 table2 > table_backup.sql

You can even go as far as auto-compressing the output using gzip (if your DB is very big):
   $ mysqldump -u [uname] -p db_name | gzip > db_backup.sql.gz

If you want to do this remotely and you have the access to the server in question, then the following would work (presuming the MySQL server is on port 3306):
   $ mysqldump -P 3306 -h [ip_address] -u [uname] -p db_name > db_backup.sql

It should drop the .sql file in the folder you run the command-line from.

EDIT: Updated to avoid inclusion of passwords in CLI commands, use the -p option without the password. It will prompt you for it and not record it.

In latest versions of mysql, at least in mine, you cannot put your pass in the command directly.

It has been some years, but I think I need to keep the information up to date!
Since PHP 7 it has been possible to create anonymous classes, so you're able to do things like this:
<?php

    class Foo {}
    $child = new class extends Foo {};

    var_dump($child instanceof Foo); // true

?>

You can read more about this in the manual
But I don't know how similar it is implemented to JavaScript, so there may be a few differences between anonymous classes in JavaScript and PHP.
",41,"
""Anonymous"" is not the correct terminology when talking about objects. It would be better to say ""object of anonymous type"", but this does not apply to PHP.
All objects in PHP have a class. The ""default"" class is stdClass, and you can create objects of it this way:
$obj = new stdClass;
$obj->aProperty = 'value';

You can also take advantage of casting an array to an object for a more convenient syntax:
$obj = (object)array('aProperty' => 'value');
print_r($obj);

However, be advised that casting an array to an object is likely to yield ""interesting"" results for those array keys that are not valid PHP variable names -- for example, here's an answer of mine that shows what happens when keys begin with digits.

An instance of an image is called a container. You have an image, which is a set of layers as you describe. If you start this image, you have a running container of this image. You can have many running containers of the same image.
You can see all your images with docker images whereas you can see your running containers with docker ps (and you can see all containers with docker ps -a).
So a running instance of an image is a container.
",1313,"
From my article on Automating Docker Deployments:
Docker Images vs. Containers
In Dockerland, there are images and there are containers. The two are closely related, but distinct. For me, grasping this dichotomy has clarified Docker immensely.
What's an Image?
An image is an inert, immutable, file that's essentially a snapshot of a container. Images are created with the build command, and they'll produce a container when started with run. Images are stored in a Docker registry such as registry.hub.docker.com. Because they can become quite large, images are designed to be composed of layers of other images, allowing a minimal amount of data to be sent when transferring images over the network.
Local images can be listed by running docker images:
REPOSITORY                TAG                 IMAGE ID            CREATED             VIRTUAL SIZE
ubuntu                    13.10               5e019ab7bf6d        2 months ago        180 MB
ubuntu                    14.04               99ec81b80c55        2 months ago        266 MB
ubuntu                    latest              99ec81b80c55        2 months ago        266 MB
ubuntu                    trusty              99ec81b80c55        2 months ago        266 MB

Some things to note:

IMAGE ID is the first 12 characters of the true identifier for an image. You can create many tags of a given image, but their IDs will all be the same (as above).
VIRTUAL SIZE is virtual because it's adding up the sizes of all the distinct underlying layers. This means that the sum of all the values in that column is probably much larger than the disk space used by all of those images.
The value in the REPOSITORY column comes from the -t flag of the docker build command, or from docker tag-ing an existing image. You're free to tag images using a nomenclature that makes sense to you, but know that docker will use the tag as the registry location in a docker push or docker pull.
The full form of a tag is [REGISTRYHOST/][USERNAME/]NAME[:TAG]. For ubuntu above, REGISTRYHOST is inferred to be registry.hub.docker.com. So if you plan on storing your image called my-application in a registry at docker.example.com, you should tag that image docker.example.com/my-application.
The TAG column is just the [:TAG] part of the full tag. This is unfortunate terminology.
The latest tag is not magical, it's simply the default tag when you don't specify a tag.
You can have untagged images only identifiable by their IMAGE IDs. These will get the <none> TAG and REPOSITORY. It's easy to forget about them.

More information on images is available from the Docker documentation and glossary.
What's a container?
To use a programming metaphor, if an image is a class, then a container is an instance of a class—a runtime object. Containers are hopefully why you're using Docker; they're lightweight and portable encapsulations of an environment in which to run applications.
View local running containers with docker ps:
CONTAINER ID        IMAGE                               COMMAND                CREATED             STATUS              PORTS                    NAMES
f2ff1af05450        samalba/docker-registry:latest      /bin/sh -c 'exec doc   4 months ago        Up 12 weeks         0.0.0.0:5000->5000/tcp   docker-registry

Here I'm running a dockerized version of the docker registry, so that I have a private place to store my images. Again, some things to note:

Like IMAGE ID, CONTAINER ID is the true identifier for the container. It has the same form, but it identifies a different kind of object.
docker ps only outputs running containers. You can view all containers (running or stopped) with docker ps -a.
NAMES can be used to identify a started container via the --name flag.

How to avoid image and container buildup
One of my early frustrations with Docker was the seemingly constant buildup of untagged images and stopped containers. On a handful of occasions this buildup resulted in maxed out hard drives slowing down my laptop or halting my automated build pipeline. Talk about ""containers everywhere""!
We can remove all untagged images by combining docker rmi with the recent dangling=true query:
docker images -q --filter ""dangling=true"" | xargs docker rmi
Docker won't be able to remove images that are behind existing containers, so you may have to remove stopped containers with docker rm first:
docker rm `docker ps --no-trunc -aq`

These are known pain points with Docker and may be addressed in future releases. However, with a clear understanding of images and containers, these situations can be avoided with a couple of practices:

Always remove a useless, stopped container with docker rm [CONTAINER_ID].
Always remove the image behind a useless, stopped container with docker rmi [IMAGE_ID].

How do I select the <li> element that is a direct parent of the anchor element?
As an example, my CSS would be something like this:

Obviously there are ways of doing this with JavaScript, but I'm hoping that there is some sort of workaround that exists native to CSS Level 2.

There is currently no way to select the parent of an element in CSS.
If there was a way to do it, it would be in either of the current CSS selectors specs:

Selectors Level 3 Spec
CSS 2.1 Selectors Spec

That said, the Selectors Level 4 Working Draft includes a :has() pseudo-class that will provide this capability. It will be similar to the jQuery implementation.
li:has(> a.active) { /* styles to apply to the li tag */ }

However, as of 2020, this is still not supported by any browser.
In the meantime, you'll have to resort to JavaScript if you need to select a parent element.

I don’t think you can select the parent in CSS only.
But as you already seem to have an .active class, it would be easier to move that class to the li (instead of the a). That way you can access both the li and the a via CSS only.

Use new Date() to generate a new Date object containing the current date and time.


var today = new Date();
var dd = String(today.getDate()).padStart(2, '0');
var mm = String(today.getMonth() + 1).padStart(2, '0'); //January is 0!
var yyyy = today.getFullYear();

today = mm + '/' + dd + '/' + yyyy;

This will give you today's date in the format of mm/dd/yyyy.
Simply change today = mm +'/'+ dd +'/'+ yyyy; to whatever format you wish.

In the following method definitions, what does the * and ** do for param2?
def foo(param1, *param2):
def bar(param1, **param2):

","779,094",2501,1047,python syntax parameter-passing variadic-functions argument-unpacking ,https://stackoverflow.com/questions/36901/what-does-double-star-asterisk-and-star-asterisk-do-for-parameters,22,"
The *args and **kwargs is a common idiom to allow arbitrary number of arguments to functions as described in the section more on defining functions in the Python documentation.
The *args will give you all function parameters as a tuple:
def foo(*args):
    for a in args:
        print(a)        

foo(1)
# 1

foo(1,2,3)
# 1
# 2
# 3

The **kwargs will give you all 
keyword arguments except for those corresponding to a formal parameter as a dictionary.
def bar(**kwargs):
    for a in kwargs:
        print(a, kwargs[a])  

bar(name='one', age=27)
# age 27
# name one

Both idioms can be mixed with normal arguments to allow a set of fixed and some variable arguments:
def foo(kind, *args, **kwargs):
   pass

It is also possible to use this the other way around:
def foo(a, b, c):
    print(a, b, c)

obj = {'b':10, 'c':'lee'}

foo(100,**obj)
# 100 10 lee

Another usage of the *l idiom is to unpack argument lists when calling a function.
def foo(bar, lee):
    print(bar, lee)

l = [1,2]

foo(*l)
# 1 2

In Python 3 it is possible to use *l on the left side of an assignment (Extended Iterable Unpacking), though it gives a list instead of a tuple in this context:
first, *rest = [1,2,3,4]
first, *l, last = [1,2,3,4]

Also Python 3 adds new semantic (refer PEP 3102):
def func(arg1, arg2, arg3, *, kwarg1, kwarg2):
    pass

Such function accepts only 3 positional arguments, and everything after * can only be passed as keyword arguments.
",2380,"
It's also worth noting that you can use * and ** when calling functions as well. This is a shortcut that allows you to pass multiple arguments to a function directly using either a list/tuple or a dictionary. For example, if you have the following function:
def foo(x,y,z):
    print(""x="" + str(x))
    print(""y="" + str(y))
    print(""z="" + str(z))

You can do things like:
>>> mylist = [1,2,3]
>>> foo(*mylist)
x=1
y=2
z=3

>>> mydict = {'x':1,'y':2,'z':3}
>>> foo(**mydict)
x=1
y=2
z=3

>>> mytuple = (1, 2, 3)
>>> foo(*mytuple)
x=1
y=2
z=3

Note: The keys in mydict have to be named exactly like the parameters of function foo. Otherwise it will throw a TypeError:
>>> mydict = {'x':1,'y':2,'z':3,'badnews':9}
>>> foo(**mydict)
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File ""<stdin>"", line 1, in <module>

","204,653",334,47,python iterator ,https://stackoverflow.com/questions/2361426/get-the-first-item-from-an-iterable-that-matches-a-condition,13,"
In Python 2.6 or newer:
If you want StopIteration to be raised if no matching element is found:
next(x for x in the_iterable if x > 3)

If you want default_value (e.g. None) to be returned instead:
next((x for x in the_iterable if x > 3), default_value)

Note that you need an extra pair of parentheses around the generator expression in this case − they are needed whenever the generator expression isn't the only argument.
I see most answers resolutely ignore the next built-in and so I assume that for some mysterious reason they're 100% focused on versions 2.5 and older -- without mentioning the Python-version issue (but then I don't see that mention in the answers that do mention the next built-in, which is why I thought it necessary to provide an answer myself -- at least the ""correct version"" issue gets on record this way;-).
In 2.5, the .next() method of iterators immediately raises StopIteration if the iterator immediately finishes -- i.e., for your use case, if no item in the iterable satisfies the condition.  If you don't care (i.e., you know there must be at least one satisfactory item) then just use .next() (best on a genexp, line for the next built-in in Python 2.6 and better).
If you do care, wrapping things in a function as you had first indicated in your Q seems best, and while the function implementation you proposed is just fine, you could alternatively use itertools, a for...: break loop, or a genexp, or a try/except StopIteration as the function's body, as various answers suggested.  There's not much added value in any of these alternatives so I'd go for the starkly-simple version you first proposed.

Damn Exceptions!
I love this answer. However, since next() raise a StopIteration exception when there are no items,
i would use the following snippet to avoid an exception:
a = []
item = next((x for x in a), None)

a = []
item = next(x for x in a)

405,2943556,335311,What is the difference between a static and a non-static initialization code block,"
My question is about one particular usage of static keyword. It is possible to use static keyword to cover a code block within a class which does not belong to any function. For example following code compiles:
public class Test {
    private static final int a;    
    static {
        a = 5;
        doSomething(a);
    }
    private static int doSomething(int x) {
        return (x+5);
    }
}

If you remove the static keyword it complains because the variable a is final. However it is possible to remove both final and static keywords and make it compile. 
It is confusing for me in both ways. How am I supposed to have a code section that does not belong to any method? How is it possible to invoke it? In general, what is the purpose of this usage? Or better, where can I find documentation about this?

The code block with the static modifier signifies a class initializer; without the static modifier the code block is an instance initializer.  
Class initializers are executed in the order they are defined (top down, just like simple variable initializers) when the class is loaded (actually, when it's resolved, but that's a technicality).
Instance initializers are executed in the order defined when the class is instantiated, immediately before the constructor code is executed, immediately after the invocation of the super constructor.
If you remove static from int a, it becomes an instance variable, which you are not able to access from the static initializer block. This will fail to compile with the error ""non-static variable a cannot be referenced from a static context"".
If you also remove static from the initializer block, it then becomes an instance initializer and so int a is initialized at construction.

This message means that for some reason the garbage collector is taking an excessive amount of time (by default 98% of all CPU time of the process) and recovers very little memory in each run (by default 2% of the heap).
This effectively means that your program stops doing any progress and is busy running only the garbage collection at all time.
To prevent your application from soaking up CPU time without getting anything done, the JVM throws this Error so that you have a chance of diagnosing the problem.
The rare cases where I've seen this happen is where some code was creating tons of temporary objects and tons of weakly-referenced objects in an already very memory-constrained environment.
Check out the Java GC tuning guide, which is available for various Java versions and contains sections about this specific problem:

Java 11 tuning guide has dedicated sections on excessive GC for different garbage collectors:


for the Parallel Collector
for the Concurrent Mark Sweep (CMS) Collector
there is no mention of this specific error condition for the Garbage First (G1) collector.

",781,"
Quoting from Oracle's article ""Java SE 6 HotSpot[tm] Virtual Machine Garbage Collection Tuning"":

Excessive GC Time and OutOfMemoryError
The parallel collector will throw an OutOfMemoryError if too much time is being spent in garbage collection: if more than 98% of the total time is spent in garbage collection and less than 2% of the heap is recovered, an OutOfMemoryError will be thrown. This feature is designed to prevent applications from running for an extended period of time while making little or no progress because the heap is too small. If necessary, this feature can be disabled by adding the option -XX:-UseGCOverheadLimit to the command line.

If you want to stick with UILabel, without subclassing it, Mundi has given you a clear solution.
If alternatively, you would be willing to avoid wrapping the UILabel with a UIView, you could use UITextView to enable the use of UIEdgeInsets (padding) or subclass UILabel to support UIEdgeInsets.
Using a UITextView would only need to provide the insets (OBJ-C):
textView.textContainerInset = UIEdgeInsetsMake(10, 0, 10, 0);

Alternative, if you subclass UILabel, an example to this approach would be overriding the drawTextInRect method

- (void)drawTextInRect:(CGRect)uiLabelRect {
    UIEdgeInsets myLabelInsets = {10, 0, 10, 0};
    [super drawTextInRect:UIEdgeInsetsInsetRect(uiLabelRect, myLabelInsets)];
}

You could additionally provide your new subclassed UILabel with insets variables for TOP, LEFT, BOTTOM and RIGHT. 
An example code could be:
In .h (OBJ-C)
float topInset, leftInset,bottomInset, rightInset;

In .m (OBJ-C)
- (void)drawTextInRect:(CGRect)uiLabelRect {
    [super drawTextInRect:UIEdgeInsetsInsetRect(uiLabelRect, UIEdgeInsetsMake(topInset,leftInset,bottomInset,rightInset))];
}

EDIT #1:
From what I have seen, it seems you have to override the intrinsicContentSize of the UILabel when subclassing it.
So you should override intrinsicContentSize like: 
- (CGSize) intrinsicContentSize {
    CGSize intrinsicSuperViewContentSize = [super intrinsicContentSize] ;
    intrinsicSuperViewContentSize.height += topInset + bottomInset ;
    intrinsicSuperViewContentSize.width += leftInset + rightInset ;
    return intrinsicSuperViewContentSize ;
}

And add the following method to edit your insets, instead of editing them individually:
- (void) setContentEdgeInsets:(UIEdgeInsets)edgeInsets {
    topInset = edgeInsets.top;
    leftInset = edgeInsets.left;
    rightInset = edgeInsets.right; 
    bottomInset = edgeInsets.bottom;
    [self invalidateIntrinsicContentSize] ;
}

It will update the size of your UILabel to match the edge insets and cover the multiline necessity you referred to.

After searching a bit I have found this Gist with an IPInsetLabel. If none of those solutions work you could try it out.

I would like to write a CSS selector rule that selects all elements that don't have a certain class. For example, given the following HTML:
<html class=""printable"">

        <h1 class=""printable"">Example</h1>
        <nav>
            <!-- Some menu links... -->

Typically you add a class selector to the :not() pseudo-class like so:
:not(.printable) {
    /* Styles */
}

:not([attribute]) {
    /* Styles */
}

But if you need better browser support (IE8 and older don't support :not()), you're probably better off creating style rules for elements that do have the ""printable"" class. If even that isn't feasible despite what you say about your actual markup, you may have to work your markup around that limitation.
Keep in mind that, depending on the properties you're setting in this rule, some of them may either be inherited by descendants that are .printable, or otherwise affect them one way or another. For example, although display is not inherited, setting display: none on a :not(.printable) will prevent it and all of its descendants from displaying, since it removes the element and its subtree from layout completely. You can often get around this by using visibility: hidden instead which will allow visible descendants to show, but the hidden elements will still affect layout as they originally did. In short, just be careful.

You can create one with:-

    date.setDate(date.getDate() + days);
    return date;
}

var date = new Date();

console.log(date.addDays(5));



This takes care of automatically incrementing the month if necessary. For example:
8/31 + 1 day will become 9/1.
The problem with using setDate directly is that it's a mutator and that sort of thing is best avoided. ECMA saw fit to treat Date as a mutable class rather than an immutable structure.

","739,637",1304,478,python oop inheritance types ,https://stackoverflow.com/questions/1549801/what-are-the-differences-between-type-and-isinstance,7,"
To summarize the contents of other (already good!) answers, isinstance caters for inheritance (an instance of a derived class is an instance of a base class, too), while checking for equality of type does not (it demands identity of types and rejects instances of subtypes, AKA subclasses).
Normally, in Python, you want your code to support inheritance, of course (since inheritance is so handy, it would be bad to stop code using yours from using it!), so isinstance is less bad than checking identity of types because it seamlessly supports inheritance.
It's not that isinstance is good, mind you—it's just less bad than checking equality of types.  The normal, Pythonic, preferred solution is almost invariably ""duck typing"": try using the argument as if it was of a certain desired type, do it in a try/except statement catching all exceptions that could arise if the argument was not in fact of that type (or any other type nicely duck-mimicking it;-), and in the except clause, try something else (using the argument ""as if"" it was of some other type).
basestring is, however, quite a special case—a builtin type that exists only to let you use isinstance (both str and unicode subclass basestring). Strings are sequences (you could loop over them, index them, slice them, ...), but you generally want to treat them as ""scalar"" types—it's somewhat incovenient (but a reasonably frequent use case) to treat all kinds of strings (and maybe other scalar types, i.e., ones you can't loop on) one way, all containers (lists, sets, dicts, ...) in another way, and basestring plus isinstance helps you do that—the overall structure of this idiom is something like:
if isinstance(x, basestring)
  return treatasscalar(x)
try:
  return treatasiter(iter(x))
except TypeError:
  return treatasscalar(x)

You could say that basestring is an Abstract Base Class (""ABC"")—it offers no concrete functionality to subclasses, but rather exists as a ""marker"", mainly for use with isinstance. The concept is obviously a growing one in Python, since PEP 3119, which introduces a generalization of it, was accepted and has been implemented starting with Python 2.6 and 3.0.
The PEP makes it clear that, while ABCs can often substitute for duck typing, there is generally no big pressure to do that (see here). ABCs as implemented in recent Python versions do however offer extra goodies: isinstance (and issubclass) can now mean more than just ""[an instance of] a derived class"" (in particular, any class can be ""registered"" with an ABC so that it will show as a subclass, and its instances as instances of the ABC); and ABCs can also offer extra convenience to actual subclasses in a very natural way via Template Method design pattern applications (see here and here [[part II]] for more on the TM DP, in general and specifically in Python, independent of ABCs).
For the underlying mechanics of ABC support as offered in Python 2.6, see here; for their 3.1 version, very similar, see here.  In both versions, standard library module collections (that's the 3.1 version—for the very similar 2.6 version, see here) offers several useful ABCs.
For the purpose of this answer, the key thing to retain about ABCs (beyond an arguably more natural placement for TM DP functionality, compared to the classic Python alternative of mixin classes such as UserDict.DictMixin) is that they make isinstance (and issubclass) much more attractive and pervasive (in Python 2.6 and going forward) than they used to be (in 2.5 and before), and therefore, by contrast, make checking type equality an even worse practice in recent Python versions than it already used to be.
",1315,"
Here's an example where isinstance achieves something that type cannot:
class Vehicle:
    pass

class Truck(Vehicle):
    pass

in this case, a truck object is a Vehicle, but you'll get this:
isinstance(Vehicle(), Vehicle)  # returns True
type(Vehicle()) == Vehicle      # returns True
isinstance(Truck(), Vehicle)    # returns True
type(Truck()) == Vehicle        # returns False, and this probably won't be what you want.

In other words, isinstance is true for subclasses, too.

I have two fields: one to store an excerpt with a max size of 500 characters, and another to store a description with a max size of 10,000 characters.
What data types should I use, TEXT or VARCHAR? And why?
After MySQL 5.0.3 VARCHAR accepts ~65000 characters. But this does not tell why I should use one type and or the other.
I'm reasoning that I should use VARCHAR for the excerpt because I can assign a size limit, and TEXT for the description field as it's larger.
","16,054",32,5,mysql database datafield ,https://stackoverflow.com/questions/6404628/varchar-vs-text-in-mysql,3,"
A long VARCHAR is stored in the same manner as a TEXT/BLOB field in InnoDB (which I assume you're using for transactionality, referential integrity and crash recovery, right?) - that is, externally to the rest of the table on disk (which may require another disk read to retrieve).

From storage prospective BLOB, TEXT as
  well as long VARCHAR are handled same
  way by Innodb. This is why Innodb
  manual calls it “long columns” rather
  than BLOBs.

source
Unless you need to index these columns (in which case VARCHAR is much faster) there is no reason to use VARCHAR over TEXT for long fields - there are some engine specific optimisations in MySQL to tune the data retrieval according to length, and you should use the correct column type to take advantage of these. 
In case you're using MyISAM an in-depth discussion on the topic is here.
",20,"
One difference between VARCHAR and TEXT is that you can declare a DEFAULT clause for a VARCHAR column, but not for a TEXT column.
@Andy is correct that InnoDB stores both VARCHAR and TEXT in the same way internally. 
FULLTEXT indexes are supported on both VARCHAR and TEXT. Prior to 5.6, you must use MyISAM to get that type of index. In MySQL 5.6, it finally supports FULLTEXT in InnoDB. Though you should test it carefully, because it seems to return different results than the implementation in MyISAM. 
However, Sphinx Search is faster and richer in features than either implementation in MySQL.  See my overview in Full-Text Search Throwdown.
@Mohammed asked:

when does VARCHAR become considered LONG VARCHAR? Is there a character threshold? 

If you declare a length of up to 255 bytes, it can encode the length of a given string using one byte. If you declare the column max length over 255 bytes, it will use two bytes to encode the length.
You can declare a column as LONG VARCHAR, but this is really just an alias for MEDIUMTEXT.

I want to write a function that will execute a shell command and return its output as a string, no matter, is it an error or success message. I just want to get the same result that I would have gotten with the command line.
What would be a code example that would do such a thing?
For example:
def run_command(cmd):
    # ??????

print run_command('mysqladmin create test -uroot -pmysqladmin12')
# Should output something like:
# mysqladmin: CREATE DATABASE failed; error: 'Can't create database 'test'; database exists'

In all officially maintained versions of Python, the simplest approach is to use the subprocess.check_output function:
>>> subprocess.check_output(['ls', '-l'])
b'total 0\n-rw-r--r--  1 memyself  staff  0 Mar 14 11:04 files\n'

check_output runs a single program that takes only arguments as input.1 It returns the result exactly as printed to stdout. If you need to write input to stdin, skip ahead to the run or Popen sections. If you want to execute complex shell commands, see the note on shell=True at the end of this answer.
The check_output function works in all officially maintained versions of Python. But for more recent versions, a more flexible approach is available.
Modern versions of Python (3.5 or higher): run
If you're using Python 3.5+, and do not need backwards compatibility, the new run function is recommended by the official documentation for most tasks. It provides a very general, high-level API for the subprocess module. To capture the output of a program, pass the subprocess.PIPE flag to the stdout keyword argument. Then access the stdout attribute of the returned CompletedProcess object:
>>> import subprocess
>>> result = subprocess.run(['ls', '-l'], stdout=subprocess.PIPE)
>>> result.stdout
b'total 0\n-rw-r--r--  1 memyself  staff  0 Mar 14 11:04 files\n'

The return value is a bytes object, so if you want a proper string, you'll need to decode it. Assuming the called process returns a UTF-8-encoded string:
>>> result.stdout.decode('utf-8')
'total 0\n-rw-r--r--  1 memyself  staff  0 Mar 14 11:04 files\n'

This can all be compressed to a one-liner if desired:
>>> subprocess.run(['ls', '-l'], stdout=subprocess.PIPE).stdout.decode('utf-8')
'total 0\n-rw-r--r--  1 memyself  staff  0 Mar 14 11:04 files\n'

If you want to pass input to the process's stdin, you can pass a bytes object to the input keyword argument:
>>> cmd = ['awk', 'length($0) > 5']
>>> ip = 'foo\nfoofoo\n'.encode('utf-8')
>>> result = subprocess.run(cmd, stdout=subprocess.PIPE, input=ip)
>>> result.stdout.decode('utf-8')
'foofoo\n'

You can capture errors by passing stderr=subprocess.PIPE (capture to result.stderr) or stderr=subprocess.STDOUT (capture to result.stdout along with regular output). If you want run to throw an exception when the process returns a nonzero exit code, you can pass check=True. (Or you can check the returncode attribute of result above.) When security is not a concern, you can also run more complex shell commands by passing shell=True as described at the end of this answer.
Later versions of Python streamline the above further. In Python 3.7+, the above one-liner can be spelled like this:
>>> subprocess.run(['ls', '-l'], capture_output=True, text=True).stdout
'total 0\n-rw-r--r--  1 memyself  staff  0 Mar 14 11:04 files\n'

Using run this way adds just a bit of complexity, compared to the old way of doing things. But now you can do almost anything you need to do with the run function alone.
Older versions of Python (3-3.4): more about check_output
If you are using an older version of Python, or need modest backwards compatibility, you can use the check_output function as briefly described above. It has been available since Python 2.7.
subprocess.check_output(*popenargs, **kwargs)  

It takes takes the same arguments as Popen (see below), and returns a string containing the program's output. The beginning of this answer has a more detailed usage example. In Python 3.5+, check_output is equivalent to executing run with check=True and stdout=PIPE, and returning just the stdout attribute.
You can pass stderr=subprocess.STDOUT to ensure that error messages are included in the returned output. When security is not a concern, you can also run more complex shell commands by passing shell=True as described at the end of this answer.
If you need to pipe from stderr or pass input to the process, check_output won't be up to the task. See the Popen examples below in that case.
Complex applications and legacy versions of Python (2.6 and below): Popen
If you need deep backwards compatibility, or if you need more sophisticated functionality than check_output or run provide, you'll have to work directly with Popen objects, which encapsulate the low-level API for subprocesses.
The Popen constructor accepts either a single command without arguments, or a list containing a command as its first item, followed by any number of arguments, each as a separate item in the list. shlex.split can help parse strings into appropriately formatted lists. Popen objects also accept a host of different arguments for process IO management and low-level configuration.
To send input and capture output, communicate is almost always the preferred method. As in:
output = subprocess.Popen([""mycmd"", ""myarg""], 
                          stdout=subprocess.PIPE).communicate()[0]

Or
>>> import subprocess
>>> p = subprocess.Popen(['ls', '-a'], stdout=subprocess.PIPE, 
...                                    stderr=subprocess.PIPE)
>>> out, err = p.communicate()
>>> print out
.
..
foo

If you set stdin=PIPE, communicate also allows you to pass data to the process via stdin:
>>> cmd = ['awk', 'length($0) > 5']
>>> p = subprocess.Popen(cmd, stdout=subprocess.PIPE,
...                           stderr=subprocess.PIPE,
...                           stdin=subprocess.PIPE)
>>> out, err = p.communicate('foo\nfoofoo\n')
>>> print out
foofoo

Note Aaron Hall's answer, which indicates that on some systems, you may need to set stdout, stderr, and stdin all to PIPE (or DEVNULL) to get communicate to work at all.
In some rare cases, you may need complex, real-time output capturing. Vartec's answer suggests a way forward, but methods other than communicate are prone to deadlocks if not used carefully.
As with all the above functions, when security is not a concern, you can run more complex shell commands by passing shell=True.
Notes
1. Running shell commands: the shell=True argument
Normally, each call to run, check_output, or the Popen constructor executes a single program. That means no fancy bash-style pipes. If you want to run complex shell commands, you can pass shell=True, which all three functions support. For example:
>>> subprocess.check_output('cat books/* | wc', shell=True, text=True)
' 1299377 17005208 101299376\n'

However, doing this raises security concerns. If you're doing anything more than light scripting, you might be better off calling each process separately, and passing the output from each as an input to the next, via
run(cmd, [stdout=etc...], input=other_output)

Or
Popen(cmd, [stdout=etc...]).communicate(other_output)

The temptation to directly connect pipes is strong; resist it. Otherwise, you'll likely see deadlocks or have to do hacky things like this.

This is way easier, but only works on Unix (including Cygwin) and Python2.7.

414,2670982,521171,A Java collection of value pairs? (tuples?),"
I like how Java has a Map where you can define the types of each entry in the map, for example <String, Integer>. 
What I'm looking for is a type of collection where each element in the collection is a pair of values.  Each value in the pair can have its own type (like the String and Integer example above), which is defined at declaration time.  
The collection will maintain its given order and will not treat one of the values as a unique key (as in a map).  
Essentially I want to be able to define an ARRAY of type <String,Integer> or any other 2 types.  
I realize that I can make a class with nothing but the 2 variables in it, but that seems overly verbose.  
I also realize that I could use a 2D array, but because of the different types I need to use, I'd have to make them arrays of OBJECT, and then I'd have to cast all the time.  
I only need to store pairs in the collection, so I only need two values per entry.  Does something like this exist without going the class route?  Thanks!

The Pair class is one of those ""gimme"" generics examples that is easy enough to write on your own. For example, off the top of my head:
public class Pair<L,R> {

  private final L left;
  private final R right;

  public Pair(L left, R right) {
    assert left != null;
    assert right != null;

    this.left = left;
    this.right = right;
  }

  public L getLeft() { return left; }
  public R getRight() { return right; }

  @Override
  public int hashCode() { return left.hashCode() ^ right.hashCode(); }

  @Override
  public boolean equals(Object o) {
    if (!(o instanceof Pair)) return false;
    Pair pairo = (Pair) o;
    return this.left.equals(pairo.getLeft()) &&
           this.right.equals(pairo.getRight());
  }

AbstractMap.SimpleEntry
Easy you are looking for this:

How can you fill it?

java.util.Map.Entry<String,Integer> pair2=new java.util.AbstractMap.SimpleEntry<>(""Not Unique key2"",2);
pairList.add(pair1);
pairList.add(pair2);

This simplifies to:
Entry<String,Integer> pair1=new SimpleEntry<>(""Not Unique key1"",1);
Entry<String,Integer> pair2=new SimpleEntry<>(""Not Unique key2"",2);
pairList.add(pair1);
pairList.add(pair2);

And, with the help of a createEntry method, can further reduce the verbosity to:
pairList.add(createEntry(""Not Unique key1"", 1));
pairList.add(createEntry(""Not Unique key2"", 2));

Since ArrayList isn't final, it can be subclassed to expose an of method (and the aforementioned createEntry method), resulting in the syntactically terse:
TupleList<java.util.Map.Entry<String,Integer>> pair = new TupleList<>();
pair.of(""Not Unique key1"", 1);

What is the difference between a framework and a library? 
I always thought of a library as a set of objects and functions that focuses on solving a particular problem or a specific area of application development (i.e. database access); and a framework on the other hand as a collection of libraries centered on a particular methodology (i.e. MVC) and which covers all areas of application development.
","311,978",889,459,frameworks language-agnostic libraries terminology ,https://stackoverflow.com/questions/148747/what-is-the-difference-between-a-framework-and-a-library,19,"
Actually these terms can mean a lot of different things depending the context they are used. 
For example, on Mac OS X frameworks are just libraries, packed into a bundle. Within the bundle you will find an actual dynamic library (libWhatever.dylib). The difference between a bare library and the framework on Mac is that a framework can contain multiple different versions of the library. It can contain extra resources (images, localized strings, XML data files, UI objects, etc.) and unless the framework is released to public, it usually contains the necessary .h files you need to use the library. 
Thus you have everything within a single package you need to use the library in your application (a C/C++/Objective-C library without .h files is pretty useless, unless you write them yourself according to some library documentation), instead of a bunch of files to move around (a Mac bundle is just a directory on the Unix level, but the UI treats it like a single file, pretty much like you have JAR files in Java and when you click it, you usually don't see what's inside, unless you explicitly select to show the content).
Wikipedia calls framework a ""buzzword"". It defines a software framework as

A software framework is a re-usable
  design for a software system (or
  subsystem). A software framework may
  include support programs, code
  libraries, a scripting language, or
  other software to help develop and
  glue together the different components
  of a software project. Various parts
  of the framework may be exposed
  through an API..

So I'd say a library is just that, ""a library"". It is a collection of objects/functions/methods (depending on your language) and your application ""links"" against it and thus can use the objects/functions/methods. It is basically a file containing re-usable code that can usually be shared among multiple applications (you don't have to write the same code over and over again).
A framework can be everything you use in application development. It can be a library, a collection of many libraries, a collection of scripts, or any piece of software you need to create your application. Framework is just a very vague term.
Here's an article about some guy regarding the topic ""Library vs. Framework"". I personally think this article is highly arguable. It's not wrong what he's saying there, however, he's just picking out one of the multiple definitions of framework and compares that to the classic definition of library. E.g. he says you need a framework for sub-classing. Really? I can have an object defined in a library, I can link against it, and sub-class it in my code. I don't see how I need a ""framework"" for that. In some way he rather explains how the term framework is used nowadays. It's just a hyped word, as I said before. Some companies release just a normal library (in any sense of a classical library) and call it a ""framework"" because it sounds more fancy.
",363,"
A library performs specific, well-defined operations.
A framework is a skeleton where the application defines the ""meat"" of the operation by filling out the skeleton.  The skeleton still has code to link up the parts but the most important work is done by the application.
Examples of libraries: Network protocols, compression, image manipulation, string utilities, regular expression evaluation, math.  Operations are self-contained.
Examples of frameworks: Web application system, Plug-in manager, GUI system.  The framework defines the concept but the application defines the fundamental functionality that end-users care about.

Looks like that is the best way to do it:
String first = strs.iterator().next();

Great question...  At first, it seems like an oversight for the Collection interface.
Note that ""first"" won't always return the first thing you put in the collection, and may only make sense for ordered collections.  Maybe that is why there isn't a get(item) call, since the order isn't necessarily preserved.
While it might seem a bit wasteful, it might not be as bad as you think.  The Iterator really just contains indexing information into the collection, not a usually a copy of the entire collection.  Invoking this method does instantiate the Iterator object, but that is really the only overhead (not like copying all the elements).
For example, looking at the type returned by the ArrayList<String>.iterator() method, we see that it is ArrayList::Itr.  This is an internal class that just accesses the elements of the list directly, rather than copying them.
Just be sure you check the return of iterator() since it may be empty or null depending on the implementation.

If you put the declaration in a header file, and the definition in a separate .cpp file, and #include the header from a different .cpp file, you will be able to see the difference.
Specifically, suppose:
lib.h
int Add(int a, int b);

lib.cpp
int Add(int a, int b = 3) {
   ...
}

test.cpp
#include ""lib.h""

int main() {
    Add(4);
}

The compilation of test.cpp will not see the default parameter declaration, and will fail with an error.
For this reason, the default parameter definition is usually specified in the function declaration:
lib.h
int Add(int a, int b = 3);

",204,"
In C++ the requirements imposed on default arguments with regard to their location in parameter list are as follows: 

Default argument for a given parameter has to be specified no more than once. Specifying it more than once (even with the same default value) is illegal.
Parameters with default arguments have to form a contiguous group at the end of the parameter list.

Now, keeping that in mind, in C++ you are allowed to ""grow"" the set of parameters that have default arguments from one declaration of the function to the next, as long as the above requirements are continuously satisfied.
For example, you can declare a function with no default arguments
void foo(int a, int b);

In order to call that function after such declaration you'll have to specify both arguments explicitly. 
Later (further down) in the same translation unit, you can re-declare it again, but this time with one default argument
void foo(int a, int b = 5);

and from this point on you can call it with just one explicit argument.
Further down you can re-declare it yet again adding one more default argument
void foo(int a = 1, int b);

and from this point on you can call it with no explicit arguments.
The full example might look as follows
void foo(int a, int b);

int main()
{
  foo(2, 3);

  void foo(int a, int b = 5); // redeclare
  foo(8); // OK, calls `foo(8, 5)`

  void foo(int a = 1, int b); // redeclare again
  foo(); // OK, calls `foo(1, 5)`
}

void foo(int a, int b)
{
  // ...
}

As for the code in your question, both variants are perfectly valid, but they mean different things. The first variant declares a default argument for the second parameter right away. The second variant initially declares your function with no default arguments and then adds one for the second parameter.
The net effect of both of your declarations (i.e. the way it is seen by the code that follows the second declaration) is exactly the same: the function has default argument for its second parameter. However, if you manage to squeeze some code between the first and the second declarations, these two variants will behave differently. In the second variant the function has no default arguments between the declarations, so you'll have to specify both arguments explicitly.

What's the difference between
var A = function () {
    this.x = function () {

and
var A = function () { };

The examples have very different outcomes.
Before looking at the differences, the following should be noted:

A constructor's prototype provides a way to share methods and values among instances via the instance's private [[Prototype]] property.
A function's this is set by how the function is called or by the use of bind (not discussed here). Where a function is called on an object (e.g. myObj.method()) then this within the method references the object. Where this is not set by the call or by the use of bind, it defaults to the global object (window in a browser) or in strict mode, remains undefined.
JavaScript is an object-oriented language, i.e. most values are objects, including functions. (Strings, numbers, and booleans are not objects.)

So here are the snippets in question:
var A = function () {
    this.x = function () {
        //do something
    };
};

In this case, variable A is assigned a value that is a reference to a function.  When that function is called using A(), the function's this isn't set by the call so it defaults to the global object and the expression this.x is effective window.x. The result is that a reference to the function expression on the right-hand side is assigned to window.x.
In the case of:
var A = function () { };
A.prototype.x = function () {
    //do something
};

something very different occurs.  In the first line, variable A is assigned a reference to a function.  In JavaScript, all functions objects have a prototype property by default so there is no separate code to create an A.prototype object.
In the second line, A.prototype.x is assigned a reference to a function. This will create an x property if it doesn't exist, or assign a new value if it does. So the difference with the first example in which object's x property is involved in the expression.
Another example is below.  It's similar to the first one (and maybe what you meant to ask about):
var A = new function () {
    this.x = function () {
        //do something
    };
};

In this example, the new operator has been added before the function expression so that the function is called as a constructor. When called with new, the function's this is set to reference a new Object whose private [[Prototype]] property is set to reference the constructor's public prototype. So in the assignment statement, the x property will be created on this new object. When called as a constructor, a function returns its this object by default, so there is no need for a separate return this; statement.
To check that A has an x property:
console.log(A.x) // function () {
                 //   //do something
                 // };

This is an uncommon use of new since the only way to reference the constructor is via A.constructor. It would be much more common to do:
var A = function () {
    this.x = function () {
        //do something
    };
};
var a = new A();

Another way of achieving a similar result is to use an immediately invoked function expression:
var A = (function () {
    this.x = function () {
        //do something
    };
}());

In this case, A assigned the return value of calling the function on the right-hand side. Here again, since this is not set in the call, it will reference the global object and this.x is effective window.x. Since the function doesn't return anything, A will have a value of undefined.
These differences between the two approaches also manifest if you're serializing and de-serializing your Javascript objects to/from JSON. Methods defined on an object's prototype are not serialized when you serialize the object, which can be convenient when for example you want to serialize just the data portions of an object, but not it's methods:
var A = function () { 
    this.objectsOwnProperties = ""are serialized"";
};
A.prototype.prototypeProperties = ""are NOT serialized"";
var instance = new A();
console.log(instance.prototypeProperties); // ""are NOT serialized""
console.log(JSON.stringify(instance)); 
// {""objectsOwnProperties"":""are serialized""}

What does it mean that JavaScript is a prototypal language?
What is the scope of a function in JavaScript?
How does the ""this"" keyword work?

Sidenote: There may not be any significant memory savings between the two approaches, however using the prototype to share methods and properties will likely use less memory than each instance having its own copy.
JavaScript isn't a low-level language.  It may not be very valuable to think of prototyping or other inheritance patterns as a way to explicitly change the way memory is allocated.

If it's just a substring search you can use string.find(""substring"").
You do have to be a little careful with find, index, and in though, as they are substring searches. In other words, this:
s = ""This be a string""
if s.find(""is"") == -1:
    print(""No 'is' here!"")
else:

It would print Found 'is' in the string. Similarly, if ""is"" in s: would evaluate to True. This may or may not be what you want.

427,107165,487258,What is a plain English explanation of “Big O” notation?,"
I'd prefer as little formal definition as possible and simple mathematics.
","714,413",5004,3989,algorithm complexity-theory computer-science big-o time-complexity ,https://stackoverflow.com/questions/487258/what-is-a-plain-english-explanation-of-big-o-notation,41,"
Quick note, this is almost certainly confusing Big O notation (which is an upper bound) with Theta notation ""Θ"" (which is a two-side bound). In my experience, this is actually typical of discussions in non-academic settings. Apologies for any confusion caused.

Big O complexity can be visualized with this graph:

The simplest definition I can give for Big-O notation is this:
Big-O notation is a relative representation of the complexity of an algorithm.
There are some important and deliberately chosen words in that sentence:


relative: you can only compare apples to apples.  You can't compare an algorithm that do arithmetic multiplication to an algorithm that sorts a list of integers.  But a comparison of two algorithms to do arithmetic operations (one multiplication, one addition) will tell you something meaningful;
representation: Big-O (in its simplest form) reduces the comparison between algorithms to a single variable.  That variable is chosen based on observations or assumptions.  For example, sorting algorithms are typically compared based on comparison operations (comparing two nodes to determine their relative ordering).  This assumes that comparison is expensive.  But what if the comparison is cheap but swapping is expensive?  It changes the comparison; and
complexity: if it takes me one second to sort 10,000 elements, how long will it take me to sort one million?  Complexity in this instance is a relative measure to something else.


Come back and reread the above when you've read the rest.
The best example of Big-O I can think of is doing arithmetic.  Take two numbers (123456 and 789012).  The basic arithmetic operations we learned in school were:


addition;
subtraction;
multiplication; and
division.


Each of these is an operation or a problem.  A method of solving these is called an algorithm.
The addition is the simplest.  You line the numbers up (to the right) and add the digits in a column writing the last number of that addition in the result.  The 'tens' part of that number is carried over to the next column.
Let's assume that the addition of these numbers is the most expensive operation in this algorithm. It stands to reason that to add these two numbers together we have to add together 6 digits (and possibly carry a 7th). If we add two 100 digit numbers together we have to do 100 additions.  If we add two 10,000 digit numbers we have to do 10,000 additions.
See the pattern?  The complexity (being the number of operations) is directly proportional to the number of digits n in the larger number.  We call this O(n) or linear complexity.
Subtraction is similar (except you may need to borrow instead of carry).
Multiplication is different. You line the numbers up, take the first digit in the bottom number and multiply it in turn against each digit in the top number and so on through each digit. So to multiply our two 6 digit numbers we must do 36 multiplications. We may need to do as many as 10 or 11 column adds to get the end result too.
If we have two 100-digit numbers we need to do 10,000 multiplications and 200 adds.  For two one million digit numbers we need to do one trillion (1012) multiplications and two million adds.
As the algorithm scales with n-squared, this is O(n2) or quadratic complexity. This is a good time to introduce another important concept:
We only care about the most significant portion of complexity.
The astute may have realized that we could express the number of operations as: n2 + 2n.  But as you saw from our example with two numbers of a million digits apiece, the second term (2n) becomes insignificant (accounting for 0.0002% of the total operations by that stage).
One can notice that we've assumed the worst case scenario here. While multiplying 6 digit numbers, if one of them has 4 digits and the other one has 6 digits, then we only have 24 multiplications. Still, we calculate the worst case scenario for that 'n', i.e when both are 6 digit numbers. Hence Big-O notation is about the Worst-case scenario of an algorithm.
The Telephone Book
The next best example I can think of is the telephone book, normally called the White Pages or similar but it varies from country to country.  But I'm talking about the one that lists people by surname and then initials or first name, possibly address and then telephone numbers.
Now if you were instructing a computer to look up the phone number for ""John Smith"" in a telephone book that contains 1,000,000 names, what would you do?  Ignoring the fact that you could guess how far in the S's started (let's assume you can't), what would you do?
A typical implementation might be to open up to the middle, take the 500,000th and compare it to ""Smith"". If it happens to be ""Smith, John"", we just got really lucky.  Far more likely is that ""John Smith"" will be before or after that name.  If it's after we then divide the last half of the phone book in half and repeat.  If it's before then we divide the first half of the phone book in half and repeat.  And so on.
This is called a binary search and is used every day in programming whether you realize it or not.
So if you want to find a name in a phone book of a million names you can actually find any name by doing this at most 20 times.  In comparing search algorithms we decide that this comparison is our 'n'.


For a phone book of 3 names it takes 2 comparisons (at most).
For 7 it takes at most 3.
For 15 it takes 4.
…
For 1,000,000 it takes 20.


That is staggeringly good, isn't it?
In Big-O terms this is O(log n) or logarithmic complexity.  Now the logarithm in question could be ln (base e), log10, log2 or some other base.  It doesn't matter it's still O(log n) just like O(2n2) and O(100n2) are still both O(n2).
It's worthwhile at this point to explain that Big O can be used to determine three cases with an algorithm:


Best Case: In the telephone book search, the best case is that we find the name in one comparison.  This is O(1) or constant complexity;
Expected Case: As discussed above this is O(log n); and
Worst Case: This is also O(log n).


Normally we don't care about the best case.  We're interested in the expected and worst case.  Sometimes one or the other of these will be more important.
Back to the telephone book.
What if you have a phone number and want to find a name?  The police have a reverse phone book but such look-ups are denied to the general public.  Or are they?  Technically you can reverse look-up a number in an ordinary phone book.  How?
You start at the first name and compare the number.  If it's a match, great, if not, you move on to the next.  You have to do it this way because the phone book is unordered (by phone number anyway).
So to find a name given the phone number (reverse lookup):


Best Case: O(1);
Expected Case: O(n) (for 500,000); and
Worst Case: O(n) (for 1,000,000).


The Traveling Salesman
This is quite a famous problem in computer science and deserves a mention.  In this problem, you have N towns. Each of those towns is linked to 1 or more other towns by a road of a certain distance. The Traveling Salesman problem is to find the shortest tour that visits every town.
Sounds simple?  Think again.
If you have 3 towns A, B, and C with roads between all pairs then you could go:


A → B → C
A → C → B
B → C → A
B → A → C
C → A → B
C → B → A


Well, actually there's less than that because some of these are equivalent (A → B → C and C → B → A are equivalent, for example, because they use the same roads, just in reverse).
In actuality, there are 3 possibilities.


Take this to 4 towns and you have (iirc) 12 possibilities.
With 5 it's 60.
6 becomes 360.


This is a function of a mathematical operation called a factorial.  Basically:


5! = 5 × 4 × 3 × 2 × 1 = 120
6! = 6 × 5 × 4 × 3 × 2 × 1 = 720
7! = 7 × 6 × 5 × 4 × 3 × 2 × 1 = 5040
…
25! = 25 × 24 × … × 2 × 1 = 15,511,210,043,330,985,984,000,000
…
50! = 50 × 49 × … × 2 × 1 = 3.04140932 × 1064


So the Big-O of the Traveling Salesman problem is O(n!) or factorial or combinatorial complexity.
By the time you get to 200 towns there isn't enough time left in the universe to solve the problem with traditional computers.
Something to think about.
Polynomial Time
Another point I wanted to make a quick mention of is that any algorithm that has a complexity of O(na) is said to have polynomial complexity or is solvable in polynomial time.
O(n), O(n2) etc. are all polynomial time. Some problems cannot be solved in polynomial time. Certain things are used in the world because of this. Public Key Cryptography is a prime example. It is computationally hard to find two prime factors of a very large number. If it wasn't, we couldn't use the public key systems we use.
Anyway, that's it for my (hopefully plain English) explanation of Big O (revised).
",6711,"
It shows how an algorithm scales based on input size.
O(n2):  known as Quadratic complexity

1 item: 1 operations
10 items: 100 operations
100 items: 10,000 operations

Notice that the number of items increases by a factor of 10, but the time increases by a factor of 102. Basically, n=10 and so O(n2) gives us the scaling factor n2 which is 102.
O(n):  known as Linear complexity

1 item: 1 second
10 items: 10 seconds
100 items: 100 seconds

This time the number of items increases by a factor of 10, and so does the time. n=10 and so O(n)'s scaling factor is 10.
O(1):  known as Constant complexity

1 item: 1 operations
10 items: 1 operations
100 items: 1 operations

The number of items is still increasing by a factor of 10, but the scaling factor of O(1) is always 1.
O(log n):  known as Logarithmic complexity

1 item: 1 operations
10 items: 2 operations
100 items: 3 operations
1000 items: 4 operations
10,000 items: 5 operations

The number of computations is only increased by a log of the input value.  So in this case, assuming each computation takes 1 second, the log of the input n is the time required, hence log n.
That's the gist of it. They reduce the maths down so it might not be exactly n2 or whatever they say it is, but that'll be the dominating factor in the scaling.

If the value is 200.3456, it should be formatted to 200.34.

","1,290,329",502,154,java double rounding ,https://stackoverflow.com/questions/2808535/round-a-double-to-2-decimal-places,13,"
Here's an utility that rounds (instead of truncating) a double to specified number of decimal places.
For example:
round(200.3456, 2); // returns 200.35

Original version; watch out with this
public static double round(double value, int places) {
    if (places < 0) throw new IllegalArgumentException();

    long factor = (long) Math.pow(10, places);
    value = value * factor;
    long tmp = Math.round(value);
    return (double) tmp / factor;
}

This breaks down badly in corner cases with either a very high number of decimal places (e.g. round(1000.0d, 17)) or large integer part (e.g. round(90080070060.1d, 9)). Thanks to Sloin for pointing this out.
I've been using the above to round ""not-too-big"" doubles to 2 or 3 decimal places happily for years (for example to clean up time in seconds for logging purposes: 27.987654321987 -> 27.99). But I guess it's best to avoid it, since more reliable ways are readily available, with cleaner code too. 
So, use this instead
(Adapted from this answer by Louis Wasserman and this one by Sean Owen.)
public static double round(double value, int places) {
    if (places < 0) throw new IllegalArgumentException();

    BigDecimal bd = BigDecimal.valueOf(value);
    bd = bd.setScale(places, RoundingMode.HALF_UP);
    return bd.doubleValue();
}

Note that HALF_UP is the rounding mode ""commonly taught at school"". Peruse the RoundingMode documentation, if you suspect you need something else such as Bankers’ Rounding.
Of course, if you prefer, you can inline the above into a one-liner:
new BigDecimal(value).setScale(places, RoundingMode.HALF_UP).doubleValue()
And in every case
Always remember that floating point representations using float and double are inexact. 
For example, consider these expressions: 
999199.1231231235 == 999199.1231231236 // true
1.03 - 0.41 // 0.6200000000000001

For exactness, you want to use BigDecimal. And while at it, use the constructor that takes a String, never the one taking double. For instance, try executing this:
System.out.println(new BigDecimal(1.03).subtract(new BigDecimal(0.41)));
System.out.println(new BigDecimal(""1.03"").subtract(new BigDecimal(""0.41"")));

Some excellent further reading on the topic:

Item 48: ""Avoid float and double if exact answers are required"" in Effective Java (2nd ed) by Joshua Bloch
What Every Programmer Should Know About Floating-Point Arithmetic


If you wanted String formatting instead of (or in addition to) strictly rounding numbers, see the other answers.  
Specifically, note that round(200, 0) returns 200.0. If you want to output ""200.00"", you should first round and then format the result for output (which is perfectly explained in Jesper's answer).
",836,"
If you just want to print a double with two digits after the decimal point, use something like this:
double value = 200.3456;
System.out.printf(""Value: %.2f"", value);

If you want to have the result in a String instead of being printed to the console, use String.format() with the same arguments:
String result = String.format(""%.2f"", value);

Or use class DecimalFormat:
DecimalFormat df = new DecimalFormat(""####0.00"");
System.out.println(""Value: "" + df.format(value));

This uses the for / else construct explained at: Why does python use 'else' after for and while loops?
Key insight:  It only seems as if the outer loop always breaks. But if the inner loop doesn't break, the outer loop won't either. 
The continue statement is the magic here. It's in the for-else clause. By definition that happens if there's no inner break. In that situation continue neatly circumvents the outer break.

430,633127,430811,Enumerate or list all variables in a program of [your favorite language here] [closed],"



A friend asked me last week how to enumerate or list all variables within a program/function/etc. for the purposes of debugging (essentially getting a snapshot of everything so you can see what variables are set to, or if they are set at all). I looked around a bit and found a relatively good way for Python:

#!/usr/bin/python                                                                                                                                                                                                                           
foo1 = ""Hello world""
foo2 = ""bar""
foo3 = {""1"":""a"",
        ""2"":""b""}
foo4 = ""1+1""

for name in dir():
    myvalue = eval(name)
    print name, ""is"", type(name), ""and is equal to "", myvalue

which will output something like:

__builtins__ is <type 'str'> and is equal to  <module '__builtin__' (built-in)>
__doc__ is <type 'str'> and is equal to  None
__file__ is <type 'str'> and is equal to  ./foo.py
__name__ is <type 'str'> and is equal to  __main__
foo1 is <type 'str'> and is equal to  Hello world
foo2 is <type 'str'> and is equal to  bar
foo3 is <type 'str'> and is equal to  {'1': 'a', '2': 'b'}
foo4 is <type 'str'> and is equal to  1+1

I have so far found a partial way in PHP (courtesy of link text) but it only lists all variables and their types, not the contents:

<?php
// create a few variables
$bar = 'foo';
$foo ='bar';
// create a new array object
$arrayObj = new ArrayObject(get_defined_vars());
// loop over the array object and echo variables and values
for($iterator = $arrayObj->getIterator(); $iterator->valid(); $iterator->next())
        {
        echo $iterator->key() . ' => ' . $iterator->current() . '<br />';
        }
?>

So I put it to you: how do you list all variables and their contents in your favorite language?

This is what it would look like in Ruby:

foo4 = '1+1'

b = binding
local_variables.each do |var|
  puts ""#{var} is #{var.class} and is equal to #{b.local_variable_get(var).inspect}""

which will output

foo2 is String and is equal to ""bar""
foo3 is String and is equal to {""1""=>""a"", ""2""=>""b""}
foo4 is String and is equal to ""1+1""
However, didn't you mean to output the type of object the variable references instead of the type used to represent the variable identifier? IOW, the type of foo3 should be Hash (or dict) instead of String, right? In that case, the code would be
#!/usr/bin/env ruby

foo1 = 'Hello world'
foo2 = 'bar'
foo3 = { '1' => 'a', '2' => 'b' }
foo4 = '1+1'

b = binding
local_variables.each do |var|
  val = b.local_variable_get(var)
  puts ""#{var} is #{val.class} and is equal to #{val.inspect}""
end

and the result is
foo1 is String and is equal to ""Hello world""
foo2 is String and is equal to ""bar""
foo3 is Hash and is equal to {""1""=>""a"", ""2""=>""b""}
foo4 is String and is equal to ""1+1""

If I want to check for the existence of a single file, I can test for it using test -e filename or [ -e filename ].
Supposing I have a glob and I want to know whether any files exist whose names match the glob. The glob can match 0 files (in which case I need to do nothing), or it can match 1 or more files (in which case I need to do something). How can I test whether a glob has any matches? (I don't care how many matches there are, and it would be best if I could do this with one if statement and no loops (simply because I find that most readable).
(test -e glob* fails if the glob matches more than one file.)

Bash specific solution:

compgen -G ""<glob-pattern>""

Escape the pattern or it'll get pre-expanded into matches.  
Exit status is:

1 for no-match, 
0 for 'one or more matches'

stdout is a list of files matching the glob.
I think this is the best option in terms of conciseness and minimizing potential side effects.
UPDATE: Example usage requested.
if compgen -G ""/tmp/someFiles*"" > /dev/null; then
    echo ""Some files exist.""
fi

",197,"
The nullglob shell option is indeed a bashism.
To avoid the need for a tedious save and restore of the nullglob state, I'd only set it inside the subshell that expands the glob:
if test -n ""$(shopt -s nullglob; echo glob*)""
then
    echo found
else
    echo not found

For better portability and more flexible globbing, use find:
if test -n ""$(find . -maxdepth 1 -name 'glob*' -print -quit)""
then
    echo found
else
    echo not found
fi

Explicit -print -quit actions are used for find instead of the default implicit -print action so that find will quit as soon as it finds the first file matching the search criteria. Where lots of files match, this should run much faster than echo glob* or ls glob* and it also avoids the possibility of overstuffing the expanded command line (some shells have a 4K length limit).
If find feels like overkill and the number of files likely to match is small, use stat:

Example:

","268,305",514,174,android string string-formatting android-resources ,https://stackoverflow.com/questions/3656371/is-it-possible-dynamically-to-add-string-to-string-xml-in-android,13,"
Formatting and Styling
Yes, see the following from String Resources: Formatting and Styling

If you need to format your strings using String.format(String, Object...), then you can do so by putting your format arguments in the string resource. For example, with the following resource:
<string name=""welcome_messages"">Hello, %1$s! You have %2$d new messages.</string>

In this example, the format string has two arguments: %1$s is a string and %2$d is a decimal number. You can format the string with arguments from your application like this:
Resources res = getResources();
String text = String.format(res.getString(R.string.welcome_messages), username, mailCount);


Basic Usage
Note that getString has an overload that uses the string as a format string:
String text = res.getString(R.string.welcome_messages, username, mailCount);

Plurals
If you need to handle plurals, use this:
<plurals name=""welcome_messages"">
    <item quantity=""one"">Hello, %1$s! You have a new message.</item>
    <item quantity=""other"">Hello, %1$s! You have %2$d new messages.</item>
</plurals>

The first mailCount param is used to decide which format to use (single or plural), the other params are your substitutions:
Resources res = getResources();
String text = res.getQuantityString(R.plurals.welcome_messages, mailCount, username, mailCount);

See String Resources: Plurals for more details.
",1072,"
Supplemental Answer
When I first saw %1$s and %2$d in the accepted answer, it made no sense. Here is a little more explanation.
They are called format specifiers. In the xml string they are in the form of
%[parameter_index$][format_type] 


%: The percent sign marks the beginning of the format specifier.
parameter index: This is a number followed by a dollar sign. If you had three parameters that you wanted to insert into the string, then they would be called 1$, 2$, and 3$. The order you place them in the resource string doesn't matter, only the order that you supply the parameters.
format type: There are a lot of ways that you can format things (see the documentation). Here are some common ones:

s string
d decimal integer
f floating point number


Example
We will create the following formatted string where the gray parts are inserted programmatically.

My sister Mary is 12 years old.

string.xml
<string name=""my_xml_string"">My sister %1$s is %2$d years old.</string>

MyActivity.java
String myString = ""Mary"";
int myInt = 12;
String formatted = getString(R.string.my_xml_string, myString, myInt);

Notes

I could use getString because I was in an Activity. You can use context.getResources().getString(...) if it is not available.
String.format() will also format a String.
The 1$ and 2$ terms don't need to be used in that order. That is, 2$ can come before 1$. This is useful when internationalizing an app for languages that use a different word order.
You can use a format specifier like %1$s multiple times in the xml if you want to repeat it.
Use %% to get the actual % character.

Given this HTML and CSS:

    width:100px;
    background-color:palevioletred;
}
<p>
    <span> Foo </span>
    <span> Bar </span>
</p>



As a result, there will be a 4 pixel wide space between the SPAN elements.
Demo: http://jsfiddle.net/dGHFV/
I understand why this happens, and I also know that I could get rid of that space by removing the white-space between the SPAN elements in the HTML source code, like so:
<p>
    <span> Foo </span><span> Bar </span>
</p>

However, I was hoping for a CSS solution that doesn't require the HTML source code to be tampered with.
I know how to solve this with JavaScript - by removing the text nodes from the container element (the paragraph), like so:
// jQuery
$('p').contents().filter(function() { return this.nodeType === 3; }).remove();

Demo: http://jsfiddle.net/dGHFV/1/
But can this issue be solved with CSS alone?

Since this answer has become rather popular, I'm rewriting it significantly.
Let's not forget the actual question that was asked:

How to remove the space between inline-block elements? I was hoping
  for a CSS solution that doesn't require the HTML source code to be
  tampered with. Can this issue be solved with CSS alone?

It is possible to solve this problem with CSS alone, but there are no completely robust CSS fixes.
The solution I had in my initial answer was to add font-size: 0 to the parent element, and then declare a sensible font-size on the children.
http://jsfiddle.net/thirtydot/dGHFV/1361/
This works in recent versions of all modern browsers. It works in IE8. It does not work in Safari 5, but it does work in Safari 6. Safari 5 is nearly a dead browser (0.33%, August 2015).
Most of the possible issues with relative font sizes are not complicated to fix.
However, while this is a reasonable solution if you specifically need a CSS only fix, it's not what I recommend if you're free to change your HTML (as most of us are).

This is what I, as a reasonably experienced web developer, actually do to solve this problem:
<p>
    <span>Foo</span><span>Bar</span>
</p>

Yes, that's right. I remove the whitespace in the HTML between the inline-block elements.
It's easy. It's simple. It works everywhere. It's the pragmatic solution.
You do sometimes have to carefully consider where whitespace will come from. Will appending another element with JavaScript add whitespace? No, not if you do it properly.
Let's go on a magical journey of different ways to remove the whitespace, with some new HTML:
<ul>
    <li>Item 1</li>
    <li>Item 2</li>
    <li>Item 3</li>
</ul>


You can do this, as I usually do:
<ul>
    <li>Item 1</li><li>Item 2</li><li>Item 3</li>
</ul>

http://jsfiddle.net/thirtydot/dGHFV/1362/
Or, this:
<ul>
    <li>Item 1</li
    ><li>Item 2</li
    ><li>Item 3</li>
</ul>

Or, use comments:
<ul>
    <li>Item 1</li><!--
    --><li>Item 2</li><!--
    --><li>Item 3</li>
</ul>

Or, if you are using using PHP or similar:
<ul>
    <li>Item 1</li><?
    ?><li>Item 2</li><?
    ?><li>Item 3</li>
</ul>

Or, you can even skip certain closing tags entirely (all browsers are fine with this):
<ul>
    <li>Item 1
    <li>Item 2
    <li>Item 3
</ul>


Now that I've gone and bored you to death with ""one thousand different ways to remove whitespace, by thirtydot"", hopefully you've forgotten all about font-size: 0.

Alternatively, you can now use flexbox to achieve many of the layouts that you may previously have used inline-block for: https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/a-guide-to-flexbox/

436,450285,89228,How to call an external command?,"
How do you call an external command (as if I'd typed it at the Unix shell or Windows command prompt) from within a Python script?
","3,528,942",5069,1553,python shell terminal subprocess command ,https://stackoverflow.com/questions/89228/how-to-call-an-external-command,62,"
Look at the subprocess module in the standard library:
import subprocess
subprocess.run([""ls"", ""-l""])

The advantage of subprocess vs. system is that it is more flexible (you can get the stdout, stderr, the ""real"" status code, better error handling, etc...).
The official documentation recommends the subprocess module over the alternative os.system():

The subprocess module provides more powerful facilities for spawning new processes and retrieving their results; using that module is preferable to using this function [os.system()].

The Replacing Older Functions with the subprocess Module section in the subprocess documentation may have some helpful recipes.
For versions of Python before 3.5, use call:
import subprocess
subprocess.call([""ls"", ""-l""])

",4867,"
Here's a summary of the ways to call external programs and the advantages and disadvantages of each:

os.system(""some_command with args"") passes the command and arguments to your system's shell.  This is nice because you can actually run multiple commands at once in this manner and set up pipes and input/output redirection.  For example:  
os.system(""some_command < input_file | another_command > output_file"")  


However, while this is convenient, you have to manually handle the escaping of shell characters such as spaces, etc.  On the other hand, this also lets you run commands which are simply shell commands and not actually external programs.  See the documentation.

stream = os.popen(""some_command with args"") will do the same thing as os.system except that it gives you a file-like object that you can use to access standard input/output for that process.  There are 3 other variants of popen that all handle the i/o slightly differently.  If you pass everything as a string, then your command is passed to the shell; if you pass them as a list then you don't need to worry about escaping anything.  See the documentation.
The Popen class of the subprocess module.  This is intended as a replacement for os.popen but has the downside of being slightly more complicated by virtue of being so comprehensive.  For example, you'd say:
print subprocess.Popen(""echo Hello World"", shell=True, stdout=subprocess.PIPE).stdout.read()

instead of: 
print os.popen(""echo Hello World"").read()

but it is nice to have all of the options there in one unified class instead of 4 different popen functions.  See the documentation.
The call function from the subprocess module.  This is basically just like the Popen class and takes all of the same arguments, but it simply waits until the command completes and gives you the return code.  For example:
return_code = subprocess.call(""echo Hello World"", shell=True)  

See the documentation.
If you're on Python 3.5 or later, you can use the new subprocess.run function, which is a lot like the above but even more flexible and returns a CompletedProcess object when the command finishes executing.
The os module also has all of the fork/exec/spawn functions that you'd have in a C program, but I don't recommend using them directly.

The subprocess module should probably be what you use.
Finally please be aware that for all methods where you pass the final command to be executed by the shell as a string and you are responsible for escaping it. There are serious security implications if any part of the string that you pass can not be fully trusted. For example, if a user is entering some/any part of the string. If you are unsure, only use these methods with constants. To give you a hint of the implications consider this code:
print subprocess.Popen(""echo %s "" % user_input, stdout=PIPE).stdout.read()

and imagine that the user enters something ""my mama didnt love me && rm -rf /"" which could erase the whole filesystem.

There's a sort of convention in JavaScript that you don't add things to Object.prototype, because it can break enumerations in various libraries. Adding methods to Object is usually safe, though.

Here's an update as of 2016 and widespread deployment of ES5 and beyond.  For IE9+ and all other modern ES5+ capable browsers, you can use Object.keys() so the above code just becomes:
var size = Object.keys(myObj).length;

This doesn't have to modify any existing prototype since Object.keys() is now built-in.
Edit: Objects can have symbolic properties that can not be returned via Object.key method. So the answer would be incomplete without mentioning them.
Symbol type was added to the language to create unique identifiers for object properties. The main benefit of the Symbol type is the prevention of overwrites.
Object.keys or Object.getOwnPropertyNames does not work for symbolic properties. To return them you need to use Object.getOwnPropertySymbols.


  var person = {
      [Symbol('name')]: 'John Doe',
      [Symbol('age')]: 33,
      ""occupation"": ""Programmer""
    };
    
    const propOwn = Object.getOwnPropertyNames(person);
    console.log(propOwn.length); // 1
    
    let propSymb = Object.getOwnPropertySymbols(person);
    console.log(propSymb.length); // 2

If you know you don't have to worry about hasOwnProperty checks, you can do this very simply:
Object.keys(myArray).length

439,1101841,914109,How to use LINQ to select object with minimum or maximum property value,"
I have a Person object with a Nullable DateOfBirth property.  Is there a way to use LINQ to query a list of Person objects for the one with the earliest/smallest DateOfBirth value.
Here's what I started with:
var firstBornDate = People.Min(p => p.DateOfBirth.GetValueOrDefault(DateTime.MaxValue));

Null DateOfBirth values are set to DateTime.MaxValue in order to rule them out of the Min consideration (assuming at least one has a specified DOB).
But all that does for me is to set firstBornDate to a DateTime value.  What I'd like to get is the Person object that matches that.  Do I need to write a second query like so:
var firstBorn = People.Single(p=> (p.DateOfBirth ?? DateTime.MaxValue) == firstBornDate);

Or is there a leaner way of doing it?

Unfortunately there isn't a built-in method to do this, but it's easy enough to implement for yourself. Here are the guts of it:
public static TSource MinBy<TSource, TKey>(this IEnumerable<TSource> source,
    Func<TSource, TKey> selector)
{
    return source.MinBy(selector, null);
}

public static TSource MinBy<TSource, TKey>(this IEnumerable<TSource> source,
    Func<TSource, TKey> selector, IComparer<TKey> comparer)
{
    if (source == null) throw new ArgumentNullException(""source"");
    if (selector == null) throw new ArgumentNullException(""selector"");
    comparer = comparer ?? Comparer<TKey>.Default;

    using (var sourceIterator = source.GetEnumerator())
    {
        if (!sourceIterator.MoveNext())
        {
            throw new InvalidOperationException(""Sequence contains no elements"");
        }
        var min = sourceIterator.Current;
        var minKey = selector(min);
        while (sourceIterator.MoveNext())
        {
            var candidate = sourceIterator.Current;
            var candidateProjected = selector(candidate);
            if (comparer.Compare(candidateProjected, minKey) < 0)
            {
                min = candidate;
                minKey = candidateProjected;
            }
        }
        return min;
    }
}

Example usage:
var firstBorn = People.MinBy(p => p.DateOfBirth ?? DateTime.MaxValue);

Note that this will throw an exception if the sequence is empty, and will return the first element with the minimal value if there's more than one.
Alternatively, you can use the implementation we've got in MoreLINQ, in MinBy.cs. (There's a corresponding MaxBy, of course.) 
Install via package manager console:
